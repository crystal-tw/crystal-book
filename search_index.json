This union type is created automatically by the compiler. At runtime, a will of course be of one type only.

When invoking a method on an expression whose type is a union type, all types in the union must respond to the method, otherwise a compile-time error is given. The type of the method call is the union type of the return types of those methods.\n# to_s is defined for Int32 and String, it returns String\na.to_s # => String\n\na + 1 # Error, because String#+(Int32) isn't defined\n\nIf necessary a variable can be defined as a union type at compile time\n# set the compile-time type\na = 0.as(Int32|Nil|String)\ntypeof(a) # => Int32 | Nil | String\nUnion types rules\nIn the general case, when two types T1 and T2 are combined, the result is a union T1 | T2. However, there are a few cases where the resulting type is a different type.\nUnion of classes and structs under the same hierarchy\nIf T1 and T2 are under the same hierarchy, and their nearest common ancestor Parent is not Reference, Struct, Int, Float nor Value, the resulting type is Parent+. This is called a virtual type, which basically means the compiler will now see the type as being Parent or any of its subtypes.\nFor example:\nclass Foo\nend\n\nclass Bar  Foo+\n\nUnion of tuples of the same size\nThe union of two tuples of the same size results in a tuple type that has the union of the types in each position.\nFor example:\nt1 = {1, \"hi\"}   # Tuple(Int32, String)\nt2 = {true, nil} # Tuple(Bool, Nil)\n\nt3 = rand \nUnion of named tuples with the same keys\nThe union of two named tuples with the same keys (regardless of their order) results in a named tuple type that has the union of the types in each key. The order of the keys will be the ones from the tuple on the left hand side.\nFor example:\nt1 = {x: 1, y: \"hi\"}   # Tuple(x: Int32, y: String)\nt2 = {y: true, x: nil} # Tuple(y: Bool, x: Nil)\n\nt3 = rand \n"},"syntax_and_semantics/control_expressions.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/control_expressions.html","title":"Control expressions","keywords":"","body":"Control expressions\nBefore talking about control expressions we need to know what truthy and falsey values are.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/truthy_and_falsey_values.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/truthy_and_falsey_values.html","title":"Truthy and falsey values","keywords":"","body":"Truthy and falsey values\nA truthy value is a value that is considered true for an if, unless, while or until guard.

A Person has a name and an age. In the \"Everything is an object\" section we said that an object has a type and responds to some methods, which is the only way to interact with objects, so we'll need both name and age methods. We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an at (@) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero. We code the \"come into existence\" part with a special initialize method, which is normally called a constructor:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def name\n    @name\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nNow we can create people like this:\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.name #=> \"John\"\njohn.age #=> 0\n\npeter.name #=> \"Peter\"\n\n(If you wonder why we needed to specify that name is a String but we didn't need to do it for age, check the global type inference algorithm)\nNote that we create a Person with new but we defined the initialization in an initialize method, not in a new method. Why is this so?\nThe answer is that when we defined an initialize method Crystal defined a new method for us, like this:\nclass Person\n  def self.new(name : String)\n    instance = Person.allocate\n    instance.initialize(name)\n    instance\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, note the self.new notation. This means that the method belongs to the class Person, not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do Person.new.\nSecond, allocate is a low-level class method that creates an uninitialized object of the given type. It basically allocates the necessary memory for the object, then initialize is invoked on it and finally the instance is returned. You generally never invoke allocate, as it is unsafe, but that's the reason why new and initialize are related.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html","title":"Methods and instance variables","keywords":"","body":"Methods and instance variables\nWe can simplify our constructor by using a shorter syntax for assigning a method argument to an instance variable:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nRight now, we can't do much with a person: create it with a name, ask for its name and for its age, which will always be zero.

However, some type annotations are required.\nConsider a class definition like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWe can quickly see that @age is an integer, but we don't know what's the type of @name. The compiler could infer its type from all uses of the Person class. However, doing so has a few issues:\n\nThe type is not obvious for a human reading the code: she would also have to check all uses of Person to find this out.\nSome compiler optimizations, like having to analyze a method just once, and incremental compilation, are nearly impossible to do.\n\nAs a code base grows, these issues gain more relevance: understanding a project becomes harder, and compile times become unbearable.\nFor this reason, Crystal needs to know, in an obvious way (as obvious as to a human), the types of instance and class variables.\nThere are several ways to let Crystal know this.\nUse an explicit type annotation\nThe easiest, but probably most tedious, way is to use explicit type annotations.\nclass Person\n  @name : String\n  @age : Int32\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nDon't use an explicit type annotation\nIf you omit an explicit type annotation the compiler will try to infer the type of instance and class variables using a bunch of syntactic rules.\nFor a given instance/class variable, when a rule can be applied and a type can be guessed, the type is added to a set. When no more rules can be applied, the inferred type will be the union of those types. Additionally, if the compiler infers that an instance variable isn't always initialized, it will also include the Nil type.\nThe rules are many, but usually the first three are most used. There's no need to remember them all. If the compiler gives an error saying that the type of an instance variable can't be inferred you can always add an explicit type annotation.\nThe following rules only mention instance variables, but they apply to class variables as well. They are:\n1. Assigning a literal value\nWhen a literal is assigned to an instance variable, the literal's type is added to the set. All literals have an associated type.\nIn the following example, @name is inferred to be String and @age to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"John Doe\"\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nThis rule, and every following rule, will also be applied in methods other than initialize. For example:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number = 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil: Int32 because 42 was assigned to it, and Nil because it wasn't assigned in all of the class' initialize methods.\n2. Assigning the result of invoking the class method new\nWhen an expression like Type.new(...) is assigned to an instance variable, the type Type is added to the set.\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.new(\"somewhere\")\n  end\nend\n\nThis also is applied to generic types. Here @values is inferred to be Array(Int32).\nclass Something\n  def initialize\n    @values = Array(Int32).new\n  end\nend\n\nNote: a new method might be redefined by a type. In that case the inferred type will be the one returned by new, if it can be inferred using some of the next rules.\n3. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a type restriction\nIn the following example @name is inferred to be String because the method argument name has a type restriction of type String, and that argument is assigned to @name.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nNote that the name of the method argument is not important; this works as well:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(obj : String)\n    @name = obj\n  end\nend\n\nUsing the shorter syntax to assign an instance variable from a method argument has the same effect:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nAlso note that the compiler doesn't check whether a method argument is reassigned a different value:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    name = 1\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, the compiler will still infer @name to be String, and later will give a compile time error, when fully typing that method, saying that Int32 can't be assigned to a variable of type String. Use an explicit type annotation if @name isn't supposed to be a String.\n4. Assigning the result of a class method that has a return type annotation\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address, because the class method Address.unknown has a return type annotation of Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  def self.unknown : Address\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nIn fact, the above code doesn't need the return type annotation in self.unknown. The reason is that the compiler will also look at a class method's body and if it can apply one of the previous rules (it's a new method, or it's a literal, etc.) it will infer the type from that expression. So, the above can be simply written like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  # No need for a return type annotation here\n  def self.unknown\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis extra rule is very convenient because it's very common to have \"constructor-like\" class methods in addition to new.\n5. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a default value\nIn the following example, because the default value of name is a string literal, and it's later assigned to @name, String will be added to the set of inferred types.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name = \"John Doe\")\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nThis of course also works with the short syntax:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name = \"John Doe\")\n  end\nend\n\nThe default value can also be a Type.new(...) method or a class method with a return type annotation.\n6. Assigning the result of invoking a lib function\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the return type when assigning it to an instance variable.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = LibPerson.compute_default_age\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age : Int32\nend\n\n7. Using an out lib expression\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the out argument's type, which should be a pointer type, and use the dereferenced type as a guess.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    LibPerson.compute_default_age(out @age)\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age(age_ptr : Int32*)\nend\n\nOther rules\nThe compiler will try to be as smart as possible to require less explicit type annotations. For example, if assigning an if expression, type will be inferred from the then and else branches:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = some_condition ? 1 : 2\n  end\nend\n\nBecause the if above (well, technically a ternary operator, but it's similar to an if) has integer literals, @age is successfully inferred to be Int32 without requiring a redundant type annotation.\nAnother case is || and ||=:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number ||= 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above example @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil. This is very useful for lazily initialized variables.\nConstants will also be followed, as it's pretty simple for the compiler (and a human) to do so.\nclass SomeObject\n  DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER = 42\n\n  def initialize(@lucky_number = DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER)\n  end\nend\n\nHere rule 5 (argument's default value) is used, and because the constant resolves to an integer literal, @lucky_number is inferred to be Int32.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/overloading.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/overloading.html","title":"Overloading","keywords":"","body":"Overloading\nWe can define a become_older method that accepts a number indicating the years to grow:\nclass Person\n  @age = 0\n\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\n\n  def become_older(years)\n    @age += years\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\njohn.age #=> 0\n\njohn.become_older\njohn.age #=> 1\n\njohn.become_older 5\njohn.age #=> 6\n\nThat is, you can have different methods with the same name and different number of arguments and they will be considered as separate methods.

So, in general, it's preferable not to specify type restrictions and almost only use them to define different method overloads. This results in more generic, reusable code.

A splat expands a Tuple into positional arguments, while a double splat expands a NamedTuple into named arguments. Multiple argument splats and double splats are allowed.\nHow call arguments are matched to method arguments\nWhen invoking a method, the algorithm to match call arguments to method arguments is:\n\nFirst positional arguments are matched with positional method arguments. The number of these must be at least the number of positional arguments without a default value. If there's a splat method argument with a name (the case without a name is explained below), more positional arguments are allowed and they are captured as a tuple. Positional arguments never match past the splat method argument.\nThen named arguments are matched, by name, with any argument in the method (it can be before or after the splat method argument). If an argument was already filled by a positional argument then it's an error.\nExtra named arguments are placed in the double splat method argument, as a NamedTuple, if it exists, otherwise it's an error.\n\nWhen a splat method argument has no name, it means no more positional arguments can be passed, and next arguments must be passed as named arguments. For example:\n# Only one positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1)\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\n\nBut even if a splat method argument has a name, arguments that follow it must be passed as named arguments:\n# One or more positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *args, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: missing argument; y\nfoo 1, 2, 3 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\nfoo 1, 2, 3, y: 4 # OK\n\nThere's also the possibility of making a method only receive named arguments (and list them), by placing the star at the beginning:\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing arguments: x, y\nfoo x: 1 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo x: 1, y: 2 # OK\n\nArguments past the star can also have default values. It means: they must be passed as named arguments, but they aren't required (so: optional named arguments):\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y = 2)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing argument: x\nfoo x: 1 # OK, y is 2\nfoo x: 1, y: 3 # OK, y is 3\n\nBecause arguments (without a default value) after the splat method argument must be passed by name, two methods with different required named arguments overload:\ndef foo(*, x)\n  puts \"Passed with x: #{x}\"\nend\n\ndef foo(*, y)\n  puts \"Passed with y: #{y}\"\nend\n\nfoo x: 1 # => Passed with x: 1\nfoo y: 2 # => Passed with y: 2\n\nPositional arguments can always be matched by name:\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1, y: 2 # OK\nfoo y: 2, x: 3 # OK\n\nExternal names\nAn external name can be specified for a method argument. The external name is the one used when passing an argument as a named argument, and the internal name is the one used inside the method definition:\ndef foo(external_name internal_name)\n  # here we use internal_name\nend\n\nfoo external_name: 1\n\nThis covers two uses cases.\nThe first use case is using keywords as named arguments:\ndef plan(begin begin_time, end end_time)\n  puts \"Planning between #{begin_time} and #{end_time}\"\nend\n\nplan begin: Time.now, end: 2.days.from_now\n\nThe second use case is making a method argument more readable inside a method body:\ndef increment(value, by)\n  # OK, but reads odd\n  value + by\nend\n\ndef increment(value, by amount)\n  # Better\n  value + amount\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nOperators like + and - are regular method calls.

We have a way to tell the compiler so by marking the class as abstract:\nabstract class Animal\nend\n\nNow the code compiles:\njohn.pet.talk #=> \"Woof!\"\n\nMarking a class as abstract will also prevent us from creating an instance of it:\nAnimal.new # Error: can't instantiate abstract class Animal\n\nTo make it more explicit that an Animal must define a talk method, we can add it to Animal as an abstract method:\nabstract class Animal\n  # Makes this animal talk\n  abstract def talk\nend\n\nBy marking a method as abstract the compiler will check that all subclasses implement this method, even if a program doesn't use them.\nAbstract methods can also be defined in modules, and the compiler will check that including types implement them.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html","title":"Class variables","keywords":"","body":"Class variables\nClass variables are associated to classes instead of instances.

The standard library usually doesn't have a namespace as its types and methods are very common, to avoid writing long names.\nTo use a module as a partial type you use include or extend.\nAn include makes a type include methods defined in that module as instance methods:\nmodule ItemsSize\n  def size\n    items.size\n  end\nend\n\nclass Items\n  include ItemsSize\n\n  def items\n    [1, 2, 3]\n  end\nend\n\nitems = Items.new\nitems.size #=> 3\n\nIn the above example, it is as if we pasted the size method from the module into the Items class. The way this really works is by making each type have a list of ancestors, or parents. By default this list starts with the superclass. As modules are included they are prepended to this list. When a method is not found in a type it is looked up in this list. When you invoke super, the first type in this ancestors list is used.\nA module can include other modules, so when a method is not found in it it will be looked up in the included modules.\nAn extend makes a type include methods defined in that module as class methods:\nmodule SomeSize\n  def size\n    3\n  end\nend\n\nclass Items\n  extend SomeSize\nend\n\nItems.size #=> 3\n\nBoth include and extend make constants defined in the module available to the including/extending type.\nBoth of them can be used at the top level to avoid writing a namespace over and over (although the chances of name clashes increase):\nmodule SomeModule\n  class SomeType\n  end\n\n  def some_method\n    1\n  end\nend\n\ninclude SomeModule\n\nSomeType.new # OK, same as SomeModule::SomeType\nsome_method  # OK, 1\n\nextend self\nA common pattern for modules is extend self:\nmodule Base64\n  extend self\n\n  def encode64(string)\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  def decode64(string)\n    # ...\n  end\nend\n\nIn this way a module can be used as a namespace:\nBase64.encode64 \"hello\" #=> \"aGVsbG8=\"\n\nBut also it can be included in the program and its methods can be invoked without a namespace:\ninclude Base64\n\nencode64 \"hello\" #=> \"aGVsbG8=\"\n\nFor this to be useful the method name should have some reference to the module, otherwise chances of name clashes are high.\nA module cannot be instantiated:\nmodule Moo\nend\n\nMoo.new # undefined method 'new' for Moo:Class\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/generics.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/generics.html","title":"Generics","keywords":"","body":"Generics\nGenerics allow to parameterize a type based on other type.

When a module is generic you include it like this:\nmodule Moo(T)\n  def t\n    T\n  end\nend\n\nclass Foo(U)\n  include Moo(U)\n\n  def initialize(@value : U)\n  end\nend\n\nfoo = Foo.new(1)\nfoo.t # Int32\n\nNote that in the above example T becomes Int32 because Foo.new(1) makes U become Int32, which in turn makes T become Int32 via the inclusion of the generic module.\nGeneric types inheritance\nGeneric classes and structs can be inherited.

A class implicitly inherits from Reference.\nA struct cannot inherit a non-abstract struct.\n\nThe last point has a reason to it: a struct has a very well defined memory layout. For example, the above Point struct occupies 8 bytes. If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer:\n# The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point\nary = [] of Point\n\nIf Point is inherited, an array of such type must also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element must grow to accommodate that. That is certainly unexpected. So, non-abstract structs can't be inherited. Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it's expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it.\nA struct can also includes modules and can be generic, just like a class.\nA struct is mostly used for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient.\nSo how do you choose between a struct and a class?

Values start with the value 0 and are incremented by one. The default value can be overwritten:\nenum Color\n  Red         # 0\n  Green       # 1\n  Blue   = 5  # overwritten to 5\n  Yellow      # 6 (5 + 1)\nend\n\nEach constant in the enum has the type of the enum:\nColor::Red #:: Color\n\nTo get the underlying value you invoke value on it:\nColor::Green.value #=> 1\n\nThe type of the value is Int32 by default but can be changed:\nenum Color : UInt8\n  Red\n  Green\n  Blue\nend\n\nColor::Red.value #:: UInt8\n\nOnly integer types are allowed as the underlying type.\nAll enums inherit from Enum.\nFlags enums\nAn enum can be marked with the @[Flags] attribute. This changes the default values:\n@[Flags]\nenum IOMode\n  Read # 1\n  Write  # 2\n  Async # 4\nend\n\nThe @[Flags] attribute makes the first constant's value be 1, and successive constants are multiplied by 2.\nImplicit constants, None and All, are automatically added to these enums, where None has the value 0 and All has the \"or\"ed value of all constants.\nIOMode::None.value #=> 0\nIOMode::All.value  #=> 7\n\nAdditionally, some Enum methods check the @[Flags] method.

For example:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\nThe above program prints \"Hello!\" twice, once for each yield.\nTo define a method that receives a block, simply use yield inside it and the compiler will know. You can make this more evident by declaring a dummy block argument, indicated as a last argument prefixed with ampersand (&):\ndef twice(&block)\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\nTo invoke a method and pass a block, you use do ... end or { ... }. All of these are equivalent:\ntwice() do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice { puts \"Hello!\" }\n\nThe difference between using do ... end and { ... } is that do ... end binds to the left-most call, while { ... } binds to the right-most call:\nfoo bar do\n  something\nend\n\n# The above is the same as\nfoo(bar) do\n  something\nend\n\nfoo bar { something }\n\n# The above is the same as\n\nfoo(bar { something })\n\nThe reason for this is to allow creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using do ... end to have them be read as plain English:\nopen file \"foo.cr\" do\n  something\nend\n\n# Same as:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\")) do\nend\n\nYou wouldn't want the above to be:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\") do\nend)\n\nOverloads\nTwo methods, one that yields and another that doesn't, are considered different overloads, as explained in the overloading section.\nYield arguments\nThe yield expression is similar to a call and can receive arguments. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Got 1\" and \"Got 2\".\nA curly braces notation is also available:\ntwice { |i| puts \"Got #{i}\" }\n\nYou can yield many values:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y, z|\n  puts x + y + z\nend\n\n# Output: 6\n\nA block can specify less than the arguments yielded:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y|\n  puts x + y\nend\n\n# Output: 3\n\nIt's an error specifying more block arguments than those yielded:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do |i| # Error: too many block arguments\nend\n\nEach block variable has the type of every yield expression in that position. For example:\ndef some\n  yield 1, 'a'\n  yield true, \"hello\"\n  yield 2, nil\nend\n\nsome do |first, second|\n  # first is Int32 | Bool\n  # second is Char | String | Nil\nend\n\nThe block variable second also includes the Nil type because the last yield expression didn't include a second argument.\nShort one-argument syntax\nA short syntax exists for specifying a block that receives a single argument and invokes a method on it. This:\nmethod do |argument|\n  argument.some_method\nend\n\nCan be written as this:\nmethod &.some_method\n\nOr like this:\nmethod(&.some_method)\n\nThe above is just syntax sugar and doesn't have any performance penalty.\nArguments can be passed to some_method as well:\nmethod &.some_method(arg1, arg2)\n\nAnd operators can be invoked too:\nmethod &.+(2)\nmethod &.[index]\n\nyield value\nThe yield expression itself has a value: the last expression of the block. For example:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  i + 1\nend\n\nThe above prints \"2\" and \"3\".\nA yield expression's value is mostly useful for transforming and filtering values. The best examples of this are Enumerable#map and Enumerable#select:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\nary.map { |x| x + 1 }         #=> [2, 3, 4]\nary.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 } #=> [1, 3]\n\nA dummy transformation method:\ndef transform(value)\n  yield value\nend\n\ntransform(1) { |x| x + 1 } #=> 2\n\nThe result of the last expression is 2 because the last expression of the transform method is yield, whose value is the last expression of the block.\nbreak\nA break expression inside a block exits early from the method:\ndef thrice\n  puts \"Before 1\"\n  yield 1\n  puts \"Before 2\"\n  yield 2\n  puts \"Before 3\"\n  yield 3\n  puts \"After 3\"\nend\n\nthrice do |i|\n  if i == 2\n    break\n  end\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Before 1\" and \"Before 2\". The thrice method didn't execute the puts \"Before 3\" expression because of the break.\nbreak can also accept arguments: these become the method's return value. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice { |i| i + 1 } #=> 3\ntwice { |i| break \"hello\" } #=> \"hello\"\n\nThe first call's value is 3 because the last expression of the twice method is yield, which gets the value of the block. The second call's value is \"hello\" because a break was performed.\nIf there are conditional breaks, the call's return value type will be a union of the type of the block's value and the type of the many breaks:\nvalue = twice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    break \"hello\"\n  end\n  i + 1\nend\nvalue #:: Int32 | String\n\nIf a break receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple:\nvalues = twice { break 1, 2 }\nvalues #=> {1, 2}\n\nIf a break receives no arguments, it's the same as receiving a single nil argument:\nvalue = twice { break }\nvalue #=> nil\n\nnext\nThe next expression inside a block exits early from the block (not the method). For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    puts \"Skipping 1\"\n    next\n  end\n\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\n# Ouptut:\n# Skipping 1\n# Got 2\n\nThe next expression accepts arguments, and these give the value of the yield expression that invoked the block:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    next 10\n  end\n\n  i + 1\nend\n\n# Output\n# 10\n# 3\n\nIf a next receives many arguments, they are automaticaly transformed to a Tuple. If it receives no arguments it's the same as receiving a single nil argument.\nwith ... yield\nA yield expression can be modified, using the with keyword, to specify an object to use as the default receiver of method calls within the block:\nclass Foo\n  def one\n    1\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\n\n  def yield_normally\n    yield\n  end\nend\n\ndef one\n  \"one\"\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { one } # => 1\nFoo.new.yield_normally { one }  # => \"one\"\n\nUnpacking block arguments\nA block argument can specify sub-arguments enclosed in parentheses:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |(number, word)|\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThe above is simply syntax sugar of this:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |arg|\n  number = arg[0]\n  word = arg[1]\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThat means that any type that responds to [] with integers can be unpacked in a block argument.\nPerformance\nWhen using blocks with yield, the blocks are always inlined: no closures, calls or function pointers are involved. This means that this:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got: #{i}\"\nend\n\nis exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 1\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\ni = 2\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\n\nFor example, the standard library includes a times method on integers, allowing you to write:\n3.times do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\nThis looks very fancy, but is it as fast as a C for loop? The answer is: yes!\nThis is Int#times definition:\nstruct Int\n  def times\n    i = 0\n    while i \nBecause a non-captured block is always inlined, the above method invocation is exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nHave no fear using blocks for readability or code reuse, it won't affect the resulting executable performance.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html","title":"Capturing blocks","keywords":"","body":"Capturing blocks\nA block can be captured and turned into a Proc, which represents a block of code with an associated context: the closured data.\nTo capture a block you must specify it as a method's block argument, give it a name and specify the input and output types.

For example:\ndef foo\n  yield\nend\n\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nThe compiler knows that after the block, x can be Int32 or String (it could know that it will always be String because the method always yields; this may improve in the future).\nIf x is assigned something else after the block, the compiler knows the type changed:\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Char\n\nHowever, if x is closured by a proc, the type is always the mixed type of all assignments to it:\ndef capture(&block)\n  block\nend\n\nx = 1\ncapture { x = \"hello\" }\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Int32 | String | Char\n\nThis is because the captured block could have been potentially stored in a class or instance variable and invoked in a separate thread in between the instructions. The compiler doesn't do an exhaustive analysis of this: it just assumes that if a variable is captured by a proc, the time of that proc invocation is unknown.\nThis also happens with regular proc literals, even if it's evident that the proc wasn't invoked or stored:\ndef capture(&block)\n  block\nend\n\nx = 1\n->{ x = \"hello\" }\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Int32 | String | Char\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/alias.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/alias.html","title":"alias","keywords":"","body":"別名 (alias)\n透過 alias 我們可以賦予型別一個不同的名子：\nalias PInt32 = Pointer(Int32)\n\nptr = PInt32.malloc(1) # : Pointer(Int32)\n\n每當別名被使用時，編譯器都將其替換回原來的型別。\n使用別名來避免撰寫過長的型別名稱時非常方便，別名也能夠用來描述遞迴型別。\nalias RecArray = Array(Int32) | Array(RecArray)\n\nary = [] of RecArray\nary.push [1, 2, 3]\nary.push ary\nary #=> [[1, 2, 3], [...]]\n\nJson 是一個常見的遞迴型別範例：\nmodule Json\n  alias Type = Nil |\n               Bool |\n               Int64 |\n               Float64 |\n               String |\n               Array(Type) |\n               Hash(String, Type)\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/type_reflection.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/type_reflection.html","title":"Type reflection","keywords":"","body":"Type reflection\nCrystal provides basic methods to do type reflection, casting and introspection.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/is_a.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/is_a.html","title":"is_a?","keywords":"","body":"is_a?\nThe pseudo-method is_a? determines whether an expression's runtime type inherits or includes another type.

For example:\nbegin\n  a = something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nThe above happens even if something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32 never raises, or if a was assigned a value and then a method that potentially raises is executed:\nbegin\n  a = 1\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nAlthough it is obvious that a will always be assigned a value, the compiler will still think a might never had a chance to be initialized. Even though this logic might improve in the future, right now it forces you to keep your exception handlers to their necessary minimum, making the code's intention more clear:\n# Clearer than the above: `a` doesn't need\n# to be in the exception handling code.\na = 1\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # works\nend\n\nAlternative ways to do error handling\nAlthough exceptions are available as one of the mechanisms for handling errors, they are not your only choice. Raising an exception involves allocating memory, and executing an exception handler is generally slow.\nThe standard library usually provides a couple of methods to accomplish something: one raises, one returns nil. For example:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\narray[4]  # raises because of IndexError\narray[4]? # returns nil because of index out of bounds\n\nThe usual convention is to provide an alternative \"question\" method to signal that this variant of the method returns nil instead of raising. This lets the user choose whether she wants to deal with exceptions or with nil. Note, however, that this is not available for every method out there, as exceptions are still the preferred way because they don't pollute the code with error handling logic.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/compile_time_flags.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/compile_time_flags.html","title":"Compile-time flags","keywords":"","body":"Compile-time flags\nTypes, methods and generally any part of your code can be conditionally defined based on some flags available at compile time.

These methods are documented in a fictitious Crystal::Macros module.\nFor example, invoking ASTNode#id in the above example solves the problem:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{content}}\n  end\nend\n\n# This correctly generates:\n#\n#     def foo\n#       1\n#     end\ndefine_method :foo, 1\n\nConditionals\nYou use {% if condition %} ... {% end %} to conditionally generate code:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name}}\n    {% if content == 1 %}\n      \"one\"\n    {% else %}\n      {{content}}\n    {% end %}\n  end\nend\n\ndefine_method foo, 1\ndefine_method bar, 2\n\nfoo #=> one\nbar #=> 2\n\nSimilar to regular code, Nop, NilLiteral and a false BoolLiteral are considered falsey, while everything else is considered truthy.\nMacro conditionals can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% if env(\"TEST\") %}\n  puts \"We are in test mode\"\n{% end %}\n\nIteration\nTo iterate an ArrayLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods [foo, bar, baz]\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nThe index variable in the above example is optional.\nTo iterate a HashLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(hash)\n  {% for key, value in hash %}\n    def {{key.id}}\n      {{value}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\ndefine_dummy_methods({foo: 10, bar: 20})\nfoo #=> 10\nbar #=> 20\n\nMacro iterations can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nVariadic arguments and splatting\nA macro can accept variadic arguments:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(*names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods foo, bar, baz\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nThe arguments are packed into an ArrayLiteral and passed to the macro.\nAdditionally, using * when interpolating an ArrayLiteral interpolates the elements separated by commas:\nmacro println(*values)\n   print {{*values}}, '\\n'\nend\n\nprintln 1, 2, 3 # outputs 123\\n\n\nType information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the current scope, or type, with a special instance variable: @type. The type of this variable is TypeNode, which gives you access to type information at compile time.\nNote that @type is always the instance type, even when the macro is invoked in a class method.\nConstants\nMacros can access constants. For example:\nVALUES = [1, 2, 3]\n\n{% for value in VALUES %}\n  puts {{value}}\n{% end %}\n\nIf the constant denotes a type, you get back a TypeNode.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html","title":"Macro methods","keywords":"","body":"Macro methods\nMacro defs allow you to define a method for a class hierarchy which is then instantiated for each concrete subtype.\nA def is implicitly considered a macro def if it contains a macro expression which refers to @type.

However, the compiler doesn't know that execute_callback can potentially raise because it is not marked as @[Raises] and the compiler has no way to figure this out. In these cases you have to manually mark such functions:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n\n  @[Raises]\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nIf you don't mark them, begin/rescue blocks that surround this function's calls won't work as expected.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html","title":"型別語法","keywords":"","body":"Type grammar\nWhen:\n\nspecifying type restrictions\nspecifying type arguments\ndeclaring variables\ndeclaring aliases\ndeclaring typedefs\nthe argument of an is_a? pseudo-call\nthe argument of an as expression\nthe argument of a sizeof expression\nthe argument of an instance_sizeof expression\na method's return type\n\na convenient syntax is provided for some common types.

The socket will handle one statement at a time. If a program needs to perform many queries simultaneously, or if it handles concurrent requests that aim to use a database, it will need more than one active connection.\nSince databases are separate services from the application using them, the connections might go down, the services might be restarted, and other sort of things the program might not want to care about.\nTo address this issues usually a connection pool is a neat solution.\nWhen a database is opened with crystal-db there is already a connection pool working.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%\n\nHowever, if you are writing a program and you realize that writing a semantically equivalent, faster version involves just minor changes, you shouldn't miss that opportunity.\nAnd always be sure to profile your program to learn what are its bottlenecks. For profiling, on Mac OSX you can use Instruments Time Profiler that comes with XCode. On Linux, a program that can profile C/C++ programs, like gprof, should work.\nMake sure to always profile programs by compiling or running programs with the --release flag, which turns on optimizations.\nAvoiding memory allocations\nOne of the best optimizations you can do in a program is avoiding extra/useless memory allocation. A memory allocation happens when you create an instance of a class, which ends up allocating heap memory. Creating an instance of a struct uses stack memory and doesn't have a performance penalty. If you don't know what's the difference between stack and heap memory, be sure to read this.\nAllocating heap memory is slow, and it puts more pressure on the the Garbage Collector (GC) as it will later have to free that memory.\nThere are several ways to avoid heap memory allocations. The standard library is designed in a way to help you do that.\nDon't create intermediate strings when writing to an IO\nTo print a number to the standard output you write:\nputs 123\nIn many programming languages what will happen is that to_s, or a similar method for converting the object to its string representation, will be invoked, and then that string will be written to the standard output. This works, but it has a flaw: it creates an intermediate string, in heap memory, only to write it and then discard it. This, involves a heap memory allocation and gives a bit of work to the GC.\nIn Crystal, puts will invoke to_s(io), on the object, passing it the IO to which to write the string representation.\nSo, you should never do this:\nputs 123.to_s\nas it will create an intermediate strings. Always append an object directly to an IO.\nWhen writing custom types, always be sure to override to_s(io), not to_s, and avoid creating intermediate strings in that method. For example:\nclass MyClass\n  # Good\n  def to_s(io)\n    # appends \"1, 2\" to IO without creating intermediate strings\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    io \nThis philosophy of appending to an IO instead of returning an intermediate strings is present in other APIs, such as in the JSON and YAML apis, where one needs to define to_json(io) and to_yaml(io) methods to write this data directly to an IO. And you should use this strategy in your API definitions too.\nLet's compare the times:\n# io_benchmark.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nio = MemoryIO.new\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"without to_s\") do\n    io \nOutput:\n$ crystal io_benchmark.cr --release\nwithout to_s  69.71M (± 6.14%)       fastest\n   with to_s  14.68M (± 2.38%)  4.75× slower\nAnd always remember that it's not just the time that has improved: memory usage is also decreased.\nAvoid creating temporary objects over and over\nConsider this program:\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n  if [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n    lines_with_language_reference += 1\n  end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\nThe above program works but has a big performance problem: on every iteration a new array is created for [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]. Remember, an array literal is just syntax sugar for creating an instance of an array and adding some values to it, and this will happen over and over on each iteration.\nThere are two ways to solve this:\n\nUse a tuple. If you use {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"} in the above program it will work the same way, but since a tuple doesn't involve heap memory it will be faster, consume less memory and give more chances for the compiler to optimize the program.\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"}.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\nMove the array to a constant.\nLANGS = [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if LANGS.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\n\nUsing tuples is the preferred way.\nExplicit array literals in loops is one way to create temporary objects, but these can also be created via method calls. For example Hash#keys will return a new array with the keys each time it's invoked. Instead of doing that, you can use Hash#each_key, Hash#has_key? and other methods.\nUse structs when possible\nIf you declare your type as a struct instead of a class, creating an instance of it will use stack memory, which is much cheaper than heap memory and doesn't put pressure on the GC.\nYou shouldn't always use a struct, though. Structs are passed by value, so if you pass one to a method and the method makes changes to it, the caller won't see those changes, so they can be bug-prone. The best thing to do is to only use structs with immutable objects, specially if they are small.\nFor example:\n# class_vs_struct.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nclass PointClass\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nstruct PointStruct\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"class\") { PointClass.new(1, 2) }\n  x.report(\"struct\") { PointStruct.new(1, 2) }\nend\n\nOutput:\n$ crystal class_vs_struct.cr --release\n class  28.17M (± 2.86%) 15.29× slower\nstruct 430.82M (± 6.58%)       fastest\nIterating strings\nStrings in crystal always contain UTF-8 encoded bytes. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding: a character may be represented by several bytes, although characters in the ASCII range are always represented with a single byte. Because of this, indexing a string with String#[] is not a O(1) operation, because each time the bytes need to be decoded to find the character at the given position. There's an optimization that Crystal's String does here: if it knows all the characters in the string are ASCII, then String#[] can be implemented in O(1). However, this isn't generally true.\nFor this reason, iterating a String this way is not optimal, and in fact it has an order of O(n^2):\nstring = ...\nwhile i \nThere's a second problem with the above: computing the size of a String is also slow, because it's not simply the number of bytes in the string (the bytesize). However, once a String computes its size once it caches it. It's still slow because of String#[].\nThe way to do it is to either use one of the iteration methods (each_char, each_byte, each_codepoint), or use the more low-level Char::Reader struct. For example, using each_char:\nstring = ...\nstring.each_char do |char|\n  # ...\nend\n\n"},"guides/concurrency.html":{"url":"guides/concurrency.html","title":"Concurrency","keywords":"","body":"Concurrency\nConcurrency vs. Parallelism\nThe definitions of \"concurrency\" and \"parallelism\" sometimes get mixed up, but they are not the same.\nA concurrent system is one that can be in charge of many tasks, although not necessarily it is executing them at the same time. You can think of yourself being in the kitchen cooking: you chop an onion, put it to fry, and while it's being fried you chop a tomato, but you are not doing all of those things at the same time: you distribute your time between those tasks. Parallelism would be to stir fry onions with one hand while with the other one you chop a tomato.\nAt the moment of this writing, Crystal has concurrency support but not parallelism: several tasks can be executed, and a bit of time will be spent on each of these, but two code paths are never executed at the same exact time.\nA Crystal program executes in a single operating system thread, except the Garbage Collector (GC) which implements a concurrent mark-and-sweep (currently Boehm GC).\nFibers\nTo achieve concurrency, Crystal has fibers. A fiber is in a way similar to an operating system thread except that it's much more lightweight and its execution is managed internally by the process. So, a program will spawn multiple fibers and Crystal will make sure to execute them when the time is right.\nEvent loop\nFor everything I/O related there's an event loop. Some time-consuming operations are delegated to it, and while the event loop waits for that operation to finish the program can continue executing other fibers. A simple example of this is waiting for data to come through a socket.\nChannels\nCrystal has Channels inspired by CSP. They allow communicating data between fibers without sharing memory and without having to worry about locks, semaphores or other special structures.\nExecution of a program\nWhen a program starts, it fires up a main fiber that will execute your top-level code. There, one can spawn many other fibers. The components of a program are:\n\nThe Runtime Scheduler, in charge of executing all fibers when the time is right.\nThe Event Loop, which is just another fiber, being in charge of async tasks, like for example files, sockets, pipes, signals and timers (like doing a sleep).\nChannels, to communicate data between fibers. The Runtime Scheduler will coordinate fibers and channels for their communication.\nGarbage Collector: to clean up \"no longer used\" memory.\n\nA Fiber\nA fiber is an execution unit that is more lightweight than a thread. It's a small object that has an associated stack of 8MB, which is what is usually assigned to an operating system thread.\nFibers, unlike threads, are cooperative. Threads are pre-emptive: the operating system might interrupt a thread at any time and start executing another one. A fiber must explicitly tell the Runtime Scheduler to switch to another fiber. For example if there's I/O to be wait, a fiber will tell the scheduler \"Look, I have to wait for this I/O to be available, you continue executing other fibers and come back to me when that I/O is ready\".\nThe advantage of being cooperative is that a lot of the overhead of doing a context switch (switching between threads) is gone.\nA Fiber is much more lightweight than a thread: even though it's assigned 8MB, it starts with a small stack of 4KB.\nOn a 64-bit machine it lets us spawn millions and millions of fibers. In a 32-bit machine we can only spawn 512 fibers, which is not a lot. But because 32-bit machines are starting to be obsolete, we plan for the future, for now focusing more on 64-bit machines.\nThe Runtime Scheduler\nThe scheduler has a queue of :\n\nFibers ready to be executed: for example when you spawn a fiber, it's ready to be executed.\nThe event loop: which is another fiber. When there are no other fibers ready to be executed, the event loop checks if there is any async operation that is ready, and then executes the fiber waiting for that operation. The event loop is currently implemented with libevent, which is an abstraction of other event mechanisms like epoll and kqueue.\nFibers that voluntarily asked to wait: this is done with Fiber.yield, which means \"I can continue executing, but I'll give you some time to execute other fibers if you want\".\n\nCommunicating data\nBecause at this moment there's only a single thread executing your code, accessing and modifying a class variable in different fibers will work just fine. However, once multiple threads (parallelism) is introduced in the language, it might break. That's why the recommended mechanism to communicate data is using channels and sending messages between them. Internally, a channel implements all the locking mechanisms to avoid data races, but from the outside you use them as communication primitives, so you (the user) don't have to use locks.\nSample code\nSpawning a fiber\nTo spawn a fiber you use spawn with a block:\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  socket.gets\n  # ...\nend\n\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  sleep 5.seconds\n  #  ...\nend\n\nHere we have two fibers: one reads from a socket and the other does a sleep. When the first fiber reaches the socket.gets line, that fiber gets suspended, the Event Loop is told to continue executing this fiber when there's data in the socket, and the program continues with the second fiber. This fiber wants to sleep for 5 seconds, so the Event Loop is told to continue with this fiber in 5 seconds. If there aren't other fibers to execute, the Event Loop will wait until either of these events happen, without consuming CPU time.\nThe reason why socket.gets and sleep behave like this is because their implementations talk directly with the Runtime Scheduler and the Event Loop; there's nothing magical about it. In general, the standard library already takes care of doing all of this so you don't have to.\nNote, however, that fibers don't get executed right away. For example:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nRunning the above code will produce no output and exit immediately.\nThe reason for this is that a fiber is not executed as soon as it is spawned. So, the main fiber, the one that spawns the above fiber, finishes its execution and the program exits.\nOne way to solve it is to do a sleep:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep 1.second\n\nThis program will now print \"Hello!\" for one second and then exit. This is because the sleep call will schedule the main fiber to be executed in a second, and then executes another \"ready to execute\" fiber, which in this case is the one above.\nAnother way is this:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nThis time Fiber.yield will tell the scheduler to execute the other fiber. This will print \"Hello!\" until the standard output blocks (the system call will tell us we have to wait until the output is ready), and then execution continues with the main fiber and the program exits. Here the standard output might never block so the program will continue executing forever.\nIf we want to execute the spawned fiber for ever, we can use sleep without arguments:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep\n\nOf course the above program can be written without spawn at all, just with a loop. sleep is more useful when spawning more than one fiber.\nSpawning a call\nYou can also spawn by passing a method call instead of a block. To understand why this is useful, let's look at this example:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThe above program prints \"10\" ten times. The problem is that there's only one variable i that all spawned fibers refer to, and when Fiber.yield is executed its value is 10.\nTo solve this, we can do this:\ni = 0\nwhile i (x : Int32) do\n    spawn do\n      puts(x)\n    end\n  end\n  proc.call(i)\n  i += 1\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nNow it works because we are creating a Proc and we invoke it passing i, so the value gets copied and now the spawned fiber receives a copy.\nTo avoid all this boilerplate, the standard library provides a spawn macro that accepts a call expression and basically rewrites it to do the above. Using it, we end up with:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThis is mostly useful with local variables that change at iterations. This doesn't happen with block arguments. For example, this works as expected:\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    puts i\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nSpawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete\nWe can use a channel for this:\nchannel = Channel(Nil).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(nil)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before receive\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"After receive\"\n\nThis prints:\nBefore receive\nBefore send\nAfter receive\n\nFirst, the program spawns a fiber but doesn't execute it yet. When we invoke channel.receive, the main fiber blocks and execution continues with the spawned fiber. Then channel.send(nil) is invoked, and so execution continues at channel.receive, which was waiting for a value. Then the main fiber continues executing and finishes, so the program exits without giving the other fiber a chance to print \"After send\".\nIn the above example we used nil just to communicate that the fiber ended. We can also use channels to communicate values between fibers:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before first send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before second send\"\n  channel.send(2)\nend\n\nputs \"Before first receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1\n\nputs \"Before second receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2\n\nOutput:\nBefore first receive\nBefore first send\n1\nBefore second receive\nBefore second send\n2\n\nNote that when the program executes a receive, that fiber blocks and execution continues with the other fiber. When send is executed, execution continues with the fiber that was waiting on that channel.\nHere we are sending literal values, but the spawned fiber might compute this value by, for example, reading a file, or getting it from a socket. When this fiber will have to wait for I/O, other fibers will be able to continue executing code until I/O is ready, and finally when the value is ready and sent through the channel, the main fiber will receive it. For example:\nrequire \"socket\"\n\nchannel = Channel(String).new\n\nspawn do\n  server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080)\n  socket = server.accept\n  while line = socket.gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\nspawn do\n  while line = gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\n3.times do\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nThe above program spawns two fibers. The first one creates a TCPServer, accepts one connection and the read lines from there, sending them to the channel. There's a second fiber that reads lines from standard input. The main fibers reads the first 3 messages that are sent to the channel, either from the socket or stdin, and then the program exits. The gets calls will block the fibers and tell the Event Loop to continue from there if data comes.\nLikewise, we can wait for multiple fibers to complete execution, and gather their values:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    channel.send(i * 2)\n  end\nend\n\nsum = 0\n10.times do\n  sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90\n\nYou can, of course, use receive inside a spawned fiber:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before receive\"\n  puts channel.receive\n  puts \"After receive\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"After yield\"\n\nOutput:\nBefore yield\nBefore send\nBefore receive\n1\nAfter receive\nAfter send\nAfter yield\n\nHere channel.send is executed first, but since there's no one waiting for a value (yet), execution continues in other fibers. The second fiber is executed, there's a value on the channel, it's obtained, and execution continues, first with the first fiber, and then with the main fiber, because Fiber.yield puts a fiber at the end of the execution queue.\nBuffered channels\nThe above examples use unbuffered channels: when sending a value, if a fiber is waiting on that channel then execution continues on that fiber.\nWith a buffered channel, invoking send won't switch to another fiber unless the buffer is full:\n# A buffered channel of capacity 2\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new(2)\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send 1\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before send 2\"\n  channel.send(2)\n  puts \"Before send 3\"\n  channel.send(3)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\n3.times do |i|\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nOutput:\nBefore send 1\nBefore send 2\nBefore send 3\n1\n2\nAfter send\n3\nNote that the first 2 sends are executed without switching to another fiber. However, in the third send the channel's buffer is full, so execution goes to the main fiber. Here the two values are received and the channel is depleted. At the third receive the main fiber blocks and execution goes to the other fiber, which sends another values, finishes, etc.\n"}}}
