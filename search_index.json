These are the only places that are looked up.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found in the require path, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThe second rule is very convenient because of the typical directory structure of a project:\n- project\n  - lib\n    - foo\n      foo.cr\n    - bar\n      bar.cr\n  - src\n    - project.cr\n  - spec\n    - project_spec.cr\nFor example, if you put require \"foo\" in project.cr and run crystal src/project.cr in the project's root directory, it will find foo in lib/foo/foo.cr.\nIf you run the compiler from somewhere else, say the src folder, lib will not be in the path and require \"foo\" can't be resolved.\nrequire \"./filename\"\nThis looks up \"filename\" relative to the file containing the require expression.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found relative to the current file, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThis relative is mostly used inside a project to refer to other files inside it.

A Person has a name and an age. In the \"Everything is an object\" section we said that an object has a type and responds to some methods, which is the only way to interact with objects, so we'll need both name and age methods. We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an at (@) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero. We code the \"come into existence\" part with a special initialize method, which is normally called a constructor:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def name\n    @name\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nNow we can create people like this:\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.name #=> \"John\"\njohn.age #=> 0\n\npeter.name #=> \"Peter\"\n\n(If you wonder why we needed to specify that name is a String but we didn't need to do it for age, check the global type inference algorithm)\nNote that we create a Person with new but we defined the initialization in an initialize method, not in a new method. Why is this so?\nThe answer is that when we defined an initialize method Crystal defined a new method for us, like this:\nclass Person\n  def self.new(name : String)\n    instance = Person.allocate\n    instance.initialize(name)\n    instance\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, note the self.new notation. This is a class method that belongs to the class Person, not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do Person.new.\nSecond, allocate is a low-level class method that creates an uninitialized object of the given type. It basically allocates the necessary memory for the object, then initialize is invoked on it and finally the instance is returned. You generally never invoke allocate, as it is unsafe, but that's the reason why new and initialize are related.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html","title":"Methods and instance variables","keywords":"","body":"Methods and instance variables\nWe can simplify our constructor by using a shorter syntax for assigning a method argument to an instance variable:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nRight now, we can't do much with a person aside from create it with a name. Its age will always be zero. So lets add a method that makes a person become older:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\n\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.age #=> 0\n\njohn.become_older\njohn.age #=> 1\n\npeter.age #=> 0\n\nMethod names begin with a lowercase letter and, as a convention, only use lowercase letters, underscores and numbers.\nGetters and setters\nThe Crystal Standard Library provides macros which simplify the definition of getter and setter methods:\nclass Person\n  property age\n  getter name : String\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\njohn.age = 32\njohn.age #=> 32\n\nFor more information on getter and setter macros, see the standard library documentation for Object#getter, Object#setter, and Object#property.\nAs a side note, we can define become_older inside the original Person definition, or in a separate definition: Crystal combines all definitions into a single class. The following works just fine:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nRedefining methods, and previous_def\nIf you redefine a method, the last definition will take precedence.\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age #=> 2\n\nYou can invoke the previously redefined method with previous_def:\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    previous_def\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age #=> 3\n\nWithout arguments or parentheses, previous_def receives the same arguments as the method's arguments. Otherwise, it receives the arguments you pass to it.\nCatch-all initialization\nInstance variables can also be initialized outside initialize methods:\nclass Person\n  @age = 0\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis will initialize @age to zero in every constructor.

However, some type annotations are required.\nConsider a class definition like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWe can quickly see that @age is an integer, but we don't know what's the type of @name. The compiler could infer its type from all uses of the Person class. However, doing so has a few issues:\n\nThe type is not obvious for a human reading the code: she would also have to check all uses of Person to find this out.\nSome compiler optimizations, like having to analyze a method just once, and incremental compilation, are nearly impossible to do.\n\nAs a code base grows, these issues gain more relevance: understanding a project becomes harder, and compile times become unbearable.\nFor this reason, Crystal needs to know, in an obvious way (as obvious as to a human), the types of instance and class variables.\nThere are several ways to let Crystal know this.\nWith type annotations\nThe easiest, but probably most tedious, way is to use explicit type annotations.\nclass Person\n  @name : String\n  @age : Int32\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWithout type annotations\nIf you omit an explicit type annotation the compiler will try to infer the type of instance and class variables using a bunch of syntactic rules.\nFor a given instance/class variable, when a rule can be applied and a type can be guessed, the type is added to a set. When no more rules can be applied, the inferred type will be the union of those types. Additionally, if the compiler infers that an instance variable isn't always initialized, it will also include the Nil type.\nThe rules are many, but usually the first three are most used. There's no need to remember them all. If the compiler gives an error saying that the type of an instance variable can't be inferred you can always add an explicit type annotation.\nThe following rules only mention instance variables, but they apply to class variables as well. They are:\n1. Assigning a literal value\nWhen a literal is assigned to an instance variable, the literal's type is added to the set. All literals have an associated type.\nIn the following example, @name is inferred to be String and @age to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"John Doe\"\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nThis rule, and every following rule, will also be applied in methods other than initialize. For example:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number = 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil: Int32 because 42 was assigned to it, and Nil because it wasn't assigned in all of the class' initialize methods.\n2. Assigning the result of invoking the class method new\nWhen an expression like Type.new(...) is assigned to an instance variable, the type Type is added to the set.\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.new(\"somewhere\")\n  end\nend\n\nThis also is applied to generic types. Here @values is inferred to be Array(Int32).\nclass Something\n  def initialize\n    @values = Array(Int32).new\n  end\nend\n\nNote: a new method might be redefined by a type. In that case the inferred type will be the one returned by new, if it can be inferred using some of the next rules.\n3. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a type restriction\nIn the following example @name is inferred to be String because the method argument name has a type restriction of type String, and that argument is assigned to @name.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nNote that the name of the method argument is not important; this works as well:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(obj : String)\n    @name = obj\n  end\nend\n\nUsing the shorter syntax to assign an instance variable from a method argument has the same effect:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nAlso note that the compiler doesn't check whether a method argument is reassigned a different value:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    name = 1\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, the compiler will still infer @name to be String, and later will give a compile time error, when fully typing that method, saying that Int32 can't be assigned to a variable of type String. Use an explicit type annotation if @name isn't supposed to be a String.\n4. Assigning the result of a class method that has a return type annotation\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address, because the class method Address.unknown has a return type annotation of Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  def self.unknown : Address\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nIn fact, the above code doesn't need the return type annotation in self.unknown. The reason is that the compiler will also look at a class method's body and if it can apply one of the previous rules (it's a new method, or it's a literal, etc.) it will infer the type from that expression. So, the above can be simply written like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  # No need for a return type annotation here\n  def self.unknown\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis extra rule is very convenient because it's very common to have \"constructor-like\" class methods in addition to new.\n5. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a default value\nIn the following example, because the default value of name is a string literal, and it's later assigned to @name, String will be added to the set of inferred types.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name = \"John Doe\")\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nThis of course also works with the short syntax:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name = \"John Doe\")\n  end\nend\n\nThe default value can also be a Type.new(...) method or a class method with a return type annotation.\n6. Assigning the result of invoking a lib function\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the return type when assigning it to an instance variable.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = LibPerson.compute_default_age\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age : Int32\nend\n\n7. Using an out lib expression\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the out argument's type, which should be a pointer type, and use the dereferenced type as a guess.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    LibPerson.compute_default_age(out @age)\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age(age_ptr : Int32*)\nend\n\nOther rules\nThe compiler will try to be as smart as possible to require less explicit type annotations. For example, if assigning an if expression, type will be inferred from the then and else branches:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = some_condition ? 1 : 2\n  end\nend\n\nBecause the if above (well, technically a ternary operator, but it's similar to an if) has integer literals, @age is successfully inferred to be Int32 without requiring a redundant type annotation.\nAnother case is || and ||=:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number ||= 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above example @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil. This is very useful for lazily initialized variables.\nConstants will also be followed, as it's pretty simple for the compiler (and a human) to do so.\nclass SomeObject\n  DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER = 42\n\n  def initialize(@lucky_number = DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER)\n  end\nend\n\nHere rule 5 (argument's default value) is used, and because the constant resolves to an integer literal, @lucky_number is inferred to be Int32.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html","title":"Union types","keywords":"","body":"Union types\nThe type of a variable or expression can consist of multiple types.

So, in general, it's preferable not to specify type restrictions and almost only use them to define different method overloads. This results in more generic, reusable code. For example, if we define a class that has a + method but isn't a Number, we can use the add method that doesn't have type restrictions, but we can't use the add method that has restrictions.\n# A class that has a + method but isn't a Number\nclass Six\n  def +(other)\n    6 + other\n  end\nend\n\n# add method without type restrictions\ndef add(x, y)\n  x + y\nend\n\n# OK\nadd Six.new, 10\n\n# add method with type restrictions\ndef restricted_add(x : Number, y : Number)\n  x + y\nend\n\n# Error: no overload matches 'restricted_add' with types Six, Int32\nrestricted_add Six.new, 10\n\nRefer to the type grammar for the notation used in type restrictions.\nNote that type restrictions do not apply to the variables inside the actual methods.\ndef handle_path(path : String)\n  path = Path.new(path) # *path* is now of the type Path\n  # Do something with *path*\nend\n\nself restriction\nA special type restriction is self:\nclass Person\n  def ==(other : self)\n    other.name == name\n  end\n\n  def ==(other)\n    false\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\nanother_john = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn == another_john #=> true\njohn == peter #=> false (names differ)\njohn == 1 #=> false (because 1 is not a Person)\n\nIn the previous example self is the same as writing Person. But, in general, self is the same as writing the type that will finally own that method, which, when modules are involved, becomes more useful.\nAs a side note, since Person inherits Reference the second definition of == is not needed, since it's already defined in Reference.\nNote that self always represents a match against an instance type, even in class methods:\nclass Person\n  def self.compare(p1 : self, p2 : self)\n    p1.name == p2.name\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\nPerson.compare(john, peter) # OK\n\nYou can use self.class to restrict to the Person type.

Additionally, the empty-tuple doesn't match any of the above cases. If you want to support the empty-tuple case, add another overload:\ndef foo\n  # This is the empty-tuple case\nend\n\nA simple way to match against one or more elements of any type is to use Object as a restriction:\ndef foo(*args : Object)\nend\n\nfoo() # Error\nfoo(1) # OK\nfoo(1, \"x\") # OK\n\nFree variables\nYou can make a type restriction take the type of an argument, or part of the type of an argument, using forall:\ndef foo(x : T) forall T\n  T\nend\n\nfoo(1)       #=> Int32\nfoo(\"hello\") #=> String\n\nThat is, T becomes the type that was effectively used to instantiate the method.\nA free variable can be used to extract the type parameter of a generic type within a type restriction:\ndef foo(x : Array(T)) forall T\n  T\nend\n\nfoo([1, 2])   #=> Int32\nfoo([1, \"a\"]) #=> (Int32 | String)\n\nTo create a method that accepts a type name, rather than an instance of a type, append .class to a free variable in the type restriction:\ndef foo(x : T.class) forall T\n  Array(T)\nend\n\nfoo(Int32)  #=> Array(Int32)\nfoo(String) #=> Array(String)\n\nMultiple free variables can be specified too, for matching types of multiple arguments:\ndef push(element : T, array : Array(T)) forall T\n  array \n"},"syntax_and_semantics/return_types.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/return_types.html","title":"Return types","keywords":"","body":"Return types\nA method's return type is always inferred by the compiler.

This is expressed as the special return type NoReturn.\nTypical examples for non-returning methods and keywords are return, exit, raise, next, and break.\nThis is for example useful for deconstructing union types:\nstring = STDIN.gets\ntypeof(string)                        # => String?\ntypeof(raise \"Empty input\")           # => NoReturn\ntypeof(string || raise \"Empty input\") # => String\nThe compiler recognizes that in case string is Nil, the right hand side of the expression string || raise will be evaluated. Since typeof(raise \"Empty input\") is NoReturn the execution would not return to the current scope in that case. That leaves only String as resulting type of the expression.\nEvery expression whose code paths all result in NoReturn will be NoReturn as well. NoReturn does not show up in a union type because it would essentially be included in every expression's type. It is only used when an expression will never return to the current scope.\nNoReturn can be explicitly set as return type of a method or function definition but will usually be inferred by the compiler.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html","title":"Method arguments","keywords":"","body":"Method arguments\nThis is the formal specification of method and call arguments.\nComponents of a method definition\nA method definition consists of:\n\nrequired and optional positional arguments\nan optional splat argument, whose name can be empty\nrequired and optional named arguments\nan optional double splat argument\n\nFor example:\ndef foo(\n  # These are positional arguments:\n  x, y, z = 1,\n  # This is the splat argument:\n  *args,\n  # These are the named arguments:\n  a, b, c = 2,\n  # This is the double splat argument:\n  **options\n  )\nend\n\nEach one of them is optional, so a method can do without the double splat, without the splat, without keyword arguments and without positional arguments.\nComponents of a method call\nA method call also has some parts:\nfoo(\n  # These are positional arguments\n  1, 2,\n  # These are named arguments\n  a: 1, b: 2\n)\n\nAdditionally, a call argument can have a splat (*) or double splat (**). A splat expands a Tuple into positional arguments, while a double splat expands a NamedTuple into named arguments. Multiple argument splats and double splats are allowed.\nHow call arguments are matched to method arguments\nWhen invoking a method, the algorithm to match call arguments to method arguments is:\n\nFirst positional arguments are matched with positional method arguments. The number of these must be at least the number of positional arguments without a default value. If there's a splat method argument with a name (the case without a name is explained below), more positional arguments are allowed and they are captured as a tuple. Positional arguments never match past the splat method argument.\nThen named arguments are matched, by name, with any argument in the method (it can be before or after the splat method argument). If an argument was already filled by a positional argument then it's an error.\nExtra named arguments are placed in the double splat method argument, as a NamedTuple, if it exists, otherwise it's an error.\n\nWhen a splat method argument has no name, it means no more positional arguments can be passed, and next arguments must be passed as named arguments. For example:\n# Only one positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1)\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\n\nBut even if a splat method argument has a name, arguments that follow it must be passed as named arguments:\n# One or more positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *args, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: missing argument; y\nfoo 1, 2, 3 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\nfoo 1, 2, 3, y: 4 # OK\n\nThere's also the possibility of making a method only receive named arguments (and list them), by placing the star at the beginning:\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing arguments: x, y\nfoo x: 1 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo x: 1, y: 2 # OK\n\nArguments past the star can also have default values. It means: they must be passed as named arguments, but they aren't required (so: optional named arguments):\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y = 2)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing argument: x\nfoo x: 1 # OK, y is 2\nfoo x: 1, y: 3 # OK, y is 3\n\nBecause arguments (without a default value) after the splat method argument must be passed by name, two methods with different required named arguments overload:\ndef foo(*, x)\n  puts \"Passed with x: #{x}\"\nend\n\ndef foo(*, y)\n  puts \"Passed with y: #{y}\"\nend\n\nfoo x: 1 # => Passed with x: 1\nfoo y: 2 # => Passed with y: 2\n\nPositional arguments can always be matched by name:\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1, y: 2 # OK\nfoo y: 2, x: 3 # OK\n\nExternal names\nAn external name can be specified for a method argument. The external name is the one used when passing an argument as a named argument, and the internal name is the one used inside the method definition:\ndef foo(external_name internal_name)\n  # here we use internal_name\nend\n\nfoo external_name: 1\n\nThis covers two uses cases.\nThe first use case is using keywords as named arguments:\ndef plan(begin begin_time, end end_time)\n  puts \"Planning between #{begin_time} and #{end_time}\"\nend\n\nplan begin: Time.now, end: 2.days.from_now\n\nThe second use case is making a method argument more readable inside a method body:\ndef increment(value, by)\n  # OK, but reads odd\n  value + by\nend\n\ndef increment(value, by amount)\n  # Better\n  value + amount\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nOperators like + and - are regular method calls.

But, on the other hand, it makes sense: classes under the same hierarchy should behave in a similar way.\nLets make John's pet talk:\njohn.pet.talk # Error: undefined method 'talk' for Animal\n\nWe get an error because the compiler now treats @pet as an Animal+, which includes Animal. And since it can't find a talk method on it, it errors.\nWhat the compiler doesn't know is that for us, Animal will never be instantiated as it doesn't make sense to instantiate one. We have a way to tell the compiler so by marking the class as abstract:\nabstract class Animal\nend\n\nNow the code compiles:\njohn.pet.talk #=> \"Woof!\"\n\nMarking a class as abstract will also prevent us from creating an instance of it:\nAnimal.new # Error: can't instantiate abstract class Animal\n\nTo make it more explicit that an Animal must define a talk method, we can add it to Animal as an abstract method:\nabstract class Animal\n  # Makes this animal talk\n  abstract def talk\nend\n\nBy marking a method as abstract the compiler will check that all subclasses implement this method, even if a program doesn't use them.\nAbstract methods can also be defined in modules, and the compiler will check that including types implement them.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html","title":"Class methods","keywords":"","body":"Class methods\nClass methods are methods associated to a class or module instead of a specific instance.\nmodule CaesarCipher\n  def self.encrypt(string : String)\n    string.chars.map{ |char| ((char.upcase.ord - 52) % 26 + 65).chr }.join\n  end\nend\n\nCaesarCipher.encrypt(\"HELLO\") # => \"URYYB\"\n\nClass methods are defined by prefixing the method name with the type name and a period.\ndef CaesarCipher.decrypt(string : String)\n  encrypt(string)\nend\n\nWhen they're defined inside a class or module scope it is easier to use self instead of the class name.\nClass methods can also be defined by extending a Module.\nA class method can be called under the same name as it was defined (CaesarCipher.decrypt(\"HELLO\")).\nWhen called from within the same class or module scope the receiver can be self or implicit (like encrypt(string)).\nConstructors\nConstructors are normal class methods which create a new instance of the class.\nBy default all classes in Crystal have at least one constructor called new, but they may also define other constructors with different names.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html","title":"Class variables","keywords":"","body":"Class variables\nClass variables are associated to classes instead of instances.

The way this really works is by making each type have a list of ancestors, or parents. By default this list starts with the superclass. As modules are included they are prepended to this list. When a method is not found in a type it is looked up in this list. When you invoke super, the first type in this ancestors list is used.\nA module can include other modules, so when a method is not found in it it will be looked up in the included modules.\nAn extend makes a type include methods defined in that module as class methods:\nmodule SomeSize\n  def size\n    3\n  end\nend\n\nclass Items\n  extend SomeSize\nend\n\nItems.size #=> 3\n\nBoth include and extend make constants defined in the module available to the including/extending type.\nBoth of them can be used at the top level to avoid writing a namespace over and over (although the chances of name clashes increase):\nmodule SomeModule\n  class SomeType\n  end\n\n  def some_method\n    1\n  end\nend\n\ninclude SomeModule\n\nSomeType.new # OK, same as SomeModule::SomeType\nsome_method  # OK, 1\n\nextend self\nA common pattern for modules is extend self:\nmodule Base64\n  extend self\n\n  def encode64(string)\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  def decode64(string)\n    # ...\n  end\nend\n\nIn this way a module can be used as a namespace:\nBase64.encode64 \"hello\" #=> \"aGVsbG8=\"\n\nBut also it can be included in the program and its methods can be invoked without a namespace:\ninclude Base64\n\nencode64 \"hello\" #=> \"aGVsbG8=\"\n\nFor this to be useful the method name should have some reference to the module, otherwise chances of name clashes are high.\nA module cannot be instantiated:\nmodule Moo\nend\n\nMoo.new # undefined method 'new' for Moo:Class\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/generics.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/generics.html","title":"Generics","keywords":"","body":"Generics\nGenerics allow you to parameterize a type based on other type.

If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer:\n# The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point\nary = [] of Point\n\nIf Point is inherited, an array of such type must also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element must grow to accommodate that.

Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it's expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it.\nA struct can also include modules and can be generic, just like a class.\nA struct is mostly used for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient.\nSo how do you choose between a struct and a class?

This changes the default values:\n@[Flags]\nenum IOMode\n  Read # 1\n  Write  # 2\n  Async # 4\nend\n\nThe @[Flags] attribute makes the first constant's value be 1, and successive constants are multiplied by 2.\nImplicit constants, None and All, are automatically added to these enums, where None has the value 0 and All has the \"or\"ed value of all constants.\nIOMode::None.value #=> 0\nIOMode::All.value  #=> 7\n\nAdditionally, some Enum methods check the @[Flags] attribute.

For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Got 1\" and \"Got 2\".\nA curly braces notation is also available:\ntwice { |i| puts \"Got #{i}\" }\n\nYou can yield many values:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y, z|\n  puts x + y + z\nend\n\n# Output: 6\n\nA block can specify less than the arguments yielded:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y|\n  puts x + y\nend\n\n# Output: 3\n\nIt's an error specifying more block arguments than those yielded:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do |i| # Error: too many block arguments\nend\n\nEach block variable has the type of every yield expression in that position.

This:\nmethod do |argument|\n  argument.some_method\nend\n\nCan be written as this:\nmethod &.some_method\n\nOr like this:\nmethod(&.some_method)\n\nThe above is just syntax sugar and doesn't have any performance penalty.\nArguments can be passed to some_method as well:\nmethod &.some_method(arg1, arg2)\n\nAnd operators can be invoked too:\nmethod &.+(2)\nmethod &.[index]\n\nyield value\nThe yield expression itself has a value: the last expression of the block. For example:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  i + 1\nend\n\nThe above prints \"2\" and \"3\".\nA yield expression's value is mostly useful for transforming and filtering values. The best examples of this are Enumerable#map and Enumerable#select:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\nary.map { |x| x + 1 }         #=> [2, 3, 4]\nary.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 } #=> [1, 3]\n\nA dummy transformation method:\ndef transform(value)\n  yield value\nend\n\ntransform(1) { |x| x + 1 } #=> 2\n\nThe result of the last expression is 2 because the last expression of the transform method is yield, whose value is the last expression of the block.\nType restrictions\nThe type of the block in a method that uses yield can be restricted using the &block syntax. For example:\ndef transform_int(start : Int32, &block : Int32 -> Int32)\n  result = yield start\n  result * 2\nend\n\ntransform_int(3) { |x| x + 2 } #=> 10\ntransform_int(3) { |x| \"foo\" } # Error: expected block to return Int32, not String\n\nbreak\nA break expression inside a block exits early from the method:\ndef thrice\n  puts \"Before 1\"\n  yield 1\n  puts \"Before 2\"\n  yield 2\n  puts \"Before 3\"\n  yield 3\n  puts \"After 3\"\nend\n\nthrice do |i|\n  if i == 2\n    break\n  end\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Before 1\" and \"Before 2\". The thrice method didn't execute the puts \"Before 3\" expression because of the break.\nbreak can also accept arguments: these become the method's return value. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice { |i| i + 1 } #=> 3\ntwice { |i| break \"hello\" } #=> \"hello\"\n\nThe first call's value is 3 because the last expression of the twice method is yield, which gets the value of the block. The second call's value is \"hello\" because a break was performed.\nIf there are conditional breaks, the call's return value type will be a union of the type of the block's value and the type of the many breaks:\nvalue = twice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    break \"hello\"\n  end\n  i + 1\nend\nvalue #:: Int32 | String\n\nIf a break receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple:\nvalues = twice { break 1, 2 }\nvalues #=> {1, 2}\n\nIf a break receives no arguments, it's the same as receiving a single nil argument:\nvalue = twice { break }\nvalue #=> nil\n\nnext\nThe next expression inside a block exits early from the block (not the method). For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    puts \"Skipping 1\"\n    next\n  end\n\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\n# Ouptut:\n# Skipping 1\n# Got 2\n\nThe next expression accepts arguments, and these give the value of the yield expression that invoked the block:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    next 10\n  end\n\n  i + 1\nend\n\n# Output\n# 10\n# 3\n\nIf a next receives many arguments, they are automaticaly transformed to a Tuple. If it receives no arguments it's the same as receiving a single nil argument.\nwith ... yield\nA yield expression can be modified, using the with keyword, to specify an object to use as the default receiver of method calls within the block:\nclass Foo\n  def one\n    1\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\n\n  def yield_normally\n    yield\n  end\nend\n\ndef one\n  \"one\"\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { one } # => 1\nFoo.new.yield_normally { one }  # => \"one\"\n\nUnpacking block arguments\nA block argument can specify sub-arguments enclosed in parentheses:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |(number, word)|\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThe above is simply syntax sugar of this:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |arg|\n  number = arg[0]\n  word = arg[1]\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThat means that any type that responds to [] with integers can be unpacked in a block argument.\nPerformance\nWhen using blocks with yield, the blocks are always inlined: no closures, calls or function pointers are involved. This means that this:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got: #{i}\"\nend\n\nis exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 1\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\ni = 2\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\n\nFor example, the standard library includes a times method on integers, allowing you to write:\n3.times do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\nThis looks very fancy, but is it as fast as a C for loop?

For example:\ndef foo\n  yield\nend\n\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nThe compiler knows that after the block, x can be Int32 or String (it could know that it will always be String because the method always yields; this may improve in the future).\nIf x is assigned something else after the block, the compiler knows the type changed:\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Char\n\nHowever, if x is closured by a proc, the type is always the mixed type of all assignments to it:\ndef capture(&block)\n  block\nend\n\nx = 1\ncapture { x = \"hello\" }\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Int32 | String | Char\n\nThis is because the captured block could have been potentially stored in a class or instance variable and invoked in a separate thread in between the instructions.

Unlike other keywords, raise is a regular method with two overloads: one accepting a String and another accepting an Exception instance:\nraise \"OH NO!\"\nraise Exception.new(\"Some error\")\n\nThe String version just creates a new Exception instance with that message.\nOnly Exception instances or subclasses can be raised.\nDefining custom exceptions\nTo define a custom exception type, just subclass from Exception:\nclass MyException \nYou can, as always, define a constructor for your exception or just use the default one.\nRescuing exceptions\nTo rescue any exception use a begin ... rescue ... end expression:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue\n  puts \"Rescued!\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued!\n\nTo access the rescued exception you can specify a variable in the rescue clause:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue ex\n  puts ex.message\nend\n\n# Output: OH NO!\n\nTo rescue just one type of exception (or any of its subclasses):\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException\n\nAnd to access it, use a syntax similar to type restrictions:\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue ex : MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException: #{ex.message}\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException: OH NO!\n\nMultiple rescue clauses can be specified:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex1 : MyException\n  # only MyException...\nrescue ex2 : MyOtherException\n  # only MyOtherException...\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nYou can also rescue multiple exception types at once by specifying a union type:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex : MyException | MyOtherException\n  # only MyException or MyOtherException\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nelse\nAn else clause is executed only if no exceptions were rescued:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute this if an exception is raised\nelse\n  # execute this if an exception isn't raised\nend\n\nAn else clause can only be specified if at least one rescue clause is specified.\nensure\nAn ensure clause is executed at the end of a begin ... end or begin ... rescue ... end expression regardless of whether an exception was raised or not:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts \"Cleanup...\"\nend\n\n# Will print \"Cleanup...\" after invoking something_dangerous,\n# regardless of whether it raised or not\n\nOr:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # ...\nelse\n  # ...\nensure\n  # this will always be executed\nend\n\nensure clauses are usually used for clean up, freeing resources, etc.\nShort syntax form\nException handling has a short syntax form: assume a method or block definition is an implicit begin ... end expression, then specify rescue, else, and ensure clauses:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute if an exception is raised\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  rescue\n    # execute if an exception is raised\n  end\nend\n\nWith ensure:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  # always execute this\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  ensure\n    # always execute this\n  end\nend\n\n# Similarly, the shorthand also works with blocks:\n(1..10).each do |n|\n  # potentially dangerous operation\nrescue\n  #..\nelse\n  #..\nensure\n  #..\nend\n\nType inference\nVariables declared inside the begin part of an exception handler also get the Nil type when considered inside a rescue or ensure body. For example:\nbegin\n  a = something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nThe above happens even if something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32 never raises, or if a was assigned a value and then a method that potentially raises is executed:\nbegin\n  a = 1\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nAlthough it is obvious that a will always be assigned a value, the compiler will still think a might never had a chance to be initialized. Even though this logic might improve in the future, right now it forces you to keep your exception handlers to their necessary minimum, making the code's intention more clear:\n# Clearer than the above: `a` doesn't need\n# to be in the exception handling code.\na = 1\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # works\nend\n\nAlternative ways to do error handling\nAlthough exceptions are available as one of the mechanisms for handling errors, they are not your only choice. Raising an exception involves allocating memory, and executing an exception handler is generally slow.\nThe standard library usually provides a couple of methods to accomplish something: one raises, one returns nil. For example:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\narray[4]  # raises because of IndexError\narray[4]? # returns nil because of index out of bounds\n\nThe usual convention is to provide an alternative \"question\" method to signal that this variant of the method returns nil instead of raising. This lets the user choose whether she wants to deal with exceptions or with nil. Note, however, that this is not available for every method out there, as exceptions are still the preferred way because they don't pollute the code with error handling logic.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html","title":"型別語法","keywords":"","body":"Type grammar\nWhen:\n\nspecifying type restrictions\nspecifying type arguments\ndeclaring variables\ndeclaring aliases\ndeclaring typedefs\nthe argument of an is_a? pseudo-call\nthe argument of an as expression\nthe argument of a sizeof expression\nthe argument of an instance_sizeof expression\na method's return type\n\na convenient syntax is provided for some common types.

These methods are documented in a fictitious Crystal::Macros module.\nFor example, invoking ASTNode#id in the above example solves the problem:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{content}}\n  end\nend\n\n# This correctly generates:\n#\n#     def foo\n#       1\n#     end\ndefine_method :foo, 1\n\nModules and classes\nModules, classes and structs can also be generated:\nmacro define_class(module_name, class_name, method, content)\n  module {{module_name}}\n    class {{class_name}}\n      def initialize(@name : String)\n      end\n\n      def {{method}}\n        {{content}} + @name\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#     module Foo\n#       class Bar\n#         def initialize(@name : String)\n#         end\n#\n#         def say\n#           \"hi \" + @name\n#         end\n#       end\n#     end\ndefine_class Foo, Bar, say, \"hi \"\n\np Foo::Bar.new(\"John\").say # => \"hi John\"\n\nConditionals\nYou use {% if condition %} ... {% end %} to conditionally generate code:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name}}\n    {% if content == 1 %}\n      \"one\"\n    {% elsif content == 2 %}\n      \"two\"\n    {% else %}\n      {{content}}\n    {% end %}\n  end\nend\n\ndefine_method foo, 1\ndefine_method bar, 2\ndefine_method baz, 3\n\nfoo #=> one\nbar #=> two\nbaz #=> 3\n\nSimilar to regular code, Nop, NilLiteral and a false BoolLiteral are considered falsey, while everything else is considered truthy.\nMacro conditionals can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% if env(\"TEST\") %}\n  puts \"We are in test mode\"\n{% end %}\n\nIteration\nYou can iterate a finite amount of times:\nmacro define_constants(count)\n  {% for i in (1..count) %}\n    PI_{{i.id}} = Math::PI * {{i}}\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_constants(3)\n\nPI_1 #=> 3.14159...\nPI_2 #=> 6.28318...\nPI_3 #=> 9.42477...\n\nTo iterate an ArrayLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods [foo, bar, baz]\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nThe index variable in the above example is optional.\nTo iterate a HashLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(hash)\n  {% for key, value in hash %}\n    def {{key.id}}\n      {{value}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\ndefine_dummy_methods({foo: 10, bar: 20})\nfoo #=> 10\nbar #=> 20\n\nMacro iterations can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nVariadic arguments and splatting\nA macro can accept variadic arguments:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(*names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods foo, bar, baz\n\nfoo #=> 0\nbar #=> 1\nbaz #=> 2\n\nThe arguments are packed into an ArrayLiteral and passed to the macro.\nAdditionally, using * when interpolating an ArrayLiteral interpolates the elements separated by commas:\nmacro println(*values)\n  print {{*values}}, '\\n'\nend\n\nprintln 1, 2, 3 # outputs 123\\n\n\nType information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the current scope, or type, with a special instance variable: @type. The type of this variable is TypeNode, which gives you access to type information at compile time.\nNote that @type is always the instance type, even when the macro is invoked in a class method.\nFor example:\nmacro add_describe_methods\n  def describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\n\n  def self.describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\nend\n\nclass Foo\n  add_describe_methods\nend\n\nFoo.new.describe #=> \"Class is Foo\"\nFoo.describe #=> \"Class is Foo\"\n\nConstants\nMacros can access constants. For example:\nVALUES = [1, 2, 3]\n\n{% for value in VALUES %}\n  puts {{value}}\n{% end %}\n\nIf the constant denotes a type, you get back a TypeNode.\nNested macros\nIt is possible to define a macro which generates one or more macro definitions. You must escape macro expressions of the inner macro by preceding them with a backslash character \"\\\" to prevent them from being evaluated by the outer macro.\nmacro define_macros(*names)\n  {% for name in names %}\n    macro greeting_for_{{name.id}}(greeting)\n      \\{% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n        \"¡hola {{name.id}}!\"\n      \\{% else %}\n        \"\\{{greeting.id}} {{name.id}}\"\n      \\{% end %}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#\n#     macro greeting_for_alice\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola alice!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} alice\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\n#     macro greeting_for_bob\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola bob!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} bob\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\ndefine_macros alice, bob\n\ngreeting_for_alice \"hello\"  #=> \"hello alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hallo\"    #=> \"hallo bob\"\ngreeting_for_alice \"hej\"    #=> \"hej alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hola\"     #=> \"¡hola bob!\"\n\nPitfalls\nWhen writing macros (especially outside of a macro definition) it is important to remember that the generated code from the macro must be valid Crystal code by itself even before it is merged into the main program's code. This means, for example, a macro cannot generate a one or more when expressions of a case statement unless case was a part of the generated code.\nHere is an example of such an invalid macro:\ncase 42\n{% for klass in [Int32, String] %}\n  when {{klass.id}}\n    p \"is {{klass}}\"\n{% end %}\nend\n\nNotice that case is not within the macro. The code generated by the macro consists solely of two when expressions which, by themselves, is not valid Crystal code. We must include case within the macro in order to make it valid by using begin and end:\n{% begin %}\n  case 42\n  {% for klass in [Int32, String] %}\n    when {{klass.id}}\n      p \"is {{klass}}\"\n  {% end %}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html","title":"Macro methods","keywords":"","body":"Macro methods\nMacro defs allow you to define a method for a class hierarchy which is then instantiated for each concrete subtype.\nA def is implicitly considered a macro def if it contains a macro expression which refers to @type.

This custom data is then sent as an argument to the callback. For example, suppose a C function that invokes a callback at every tick, passing that tick:\nlib LibTicker\n  fun on_tick(callback : (Int32, Void* ->), data : Void*)\nend\n\nTo properly define a wrapper for this function we must send the Proc as the callback data, and then convert that callback data to the Proc and finally invoke it.\nmodule Ticker\n  @@box : Box(Int32 ->)\n\n  # The callback for the user doesn't have a Void*\n  def self.on_tick(&callback : Int32 ->)\n    # Since Proc is a {Void*, Void*}, we can't turn that into a Void*, so we\n    # \"box\" it: we allocate memory and store the Proc there\n    boxed_data = Box.box(callback)\n\n    # We must save this in Crystal-land so the GC doesn't collect it (*)\n    @@box = boxed_data\n\n    # We pass a callback that doesn't form a closure, and pass the boxed_data as\n    # the callback data\n    LibTicker.on_tick(->(tick, data) {\n      # Now we turn data back into the Proc, using Box.unbox\n      data_as_callback = Box(typeof(callback)).unbox(data)\n      # And finally invoke the user's callback\n      data_as_callback.call(tick)\n    }, boxed_data)\n  end\nend\n\nTicker.on_tick do |tick|\n  puts tick\nend\n\nNote that we save the boxed callback in @@box. The reason is that if we don't do it, and our code doesn't reference it anymore, the GC will collect it. The C library will of course store the callback, but Crystal's GC has no way of knowing that.\nRaises attribute\nIf a C function executes a user-provided callback that might raise, it must be annotated with the @[Raises] attribute.\nThe compiler infers this attribute for a method if it invokes a method that is marked as @[Raises] or raises (recursively).\nHowever, some C functions accept callbacks to be executed by other C functions. For example, suppose a fictitious library:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nLibFoo.store_callback ->{ raise \"OH NO!\" }\nLibFoo.execute_callback\n\nIf the callback passed to store_callback raises, then execute_callback will raise. However, the compiler doesn't know that execute_callback can potentially raise because it is not marked as @[Raises] and the compiler has no way to figure this out. In these cases you have to manually mark such functions:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n\n  @[Raises]\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nIf you don't mark them, begin/rescue blocks that surround this function's calls won't work as expected.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html","title":"Unsafe code","keywords":"","body":"Unsafe code\nThese parts of the language are considered unsafe:\n\nCode involving raw pointers: the Pointer type and pointerof.\nThe allocate class method.\nCode involving C bindings\nUninitialized variable declaration\n\n\"Unsafe\" means that memory corruption, segmentation faults and crashes are possible to achieve.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.\n\nHowever, if you are writing a program and you realize that writing a semantically equivalent, faster version involves just minor changes, you shouldn't miss that opportunity.\nAnd always be sure to profile your program to learn what its bottlenecks are. For profiling, on macOS you can use Instruments Time Profiler, which comes with XCode. On Linux, any program that can profile C/C++ programs, like perf or Callgrind, should work.\nMake sure to always profile programs by compiling or running them with the --release flag, which turns on optimizations.\nAvoiding memory allocations\nOne of the best optimizations you can do in a program is avoiding extra/useless memory allocation. A memory allocation happens when you create an instance of a class, which ends up allocating heap memory. Creating an instance of a struct uses stack memory and doesn't incur a performance penalty. If you don't know the difference between stack and heap memory, be sure to read this.\nAllocating heap memory is slow, and it puts more pressure on the Garbage Collector (GC) as it will later have to free that memory.\nThere are several ways to avoid heap memory allocations. The standard library is designed in a way to help you do that.\nDon't create intermediate strings when writing to an IO\nTo print a number to the standard output you write:\nputs 123\nIn many programming languages what will happen is that to_s, or a similar method for converting the object to its string representation, will be invoked, and then that string will be written to the standard output. This works, but it has a flaw: it creates an intermediate string, in heap memory, only to write it and then discard it. This, involves a heap memory allocation and gives a bit of work to the GC.\nIn Crystal, puts will invoke to_s(io) on the object, passing it the IO to which the string representation should be written.\nSo, you should never do this:\nputs 123.to_s\nas it will create an intermediate string. Always append an object directly to an IO.\nWhen writing custom types, always be sure to override to_s(io), not to_s, and avoid creating intermediate strings in that method. For example:\nclass MyClass\n  # Good\n  def to_s(io)\n    # appends \"1, 2\" to IO without creating intermediate strings\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    io \nThis philosophy of appending to an IO instead of returning an intermediate string results in better performance than handling intermediate strings. You should use this strategy in your API definitions too.\nLet's compare the times:\n# io_benchmark.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nio = IO::Memory.new\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"without to_s\") do\n    io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release io_benchmark.cr\nwithout to_s  77.11M ( 12.97ns) (± 1.05%)       fastest\n   with to_s  18.15M ( 55.09ns) (± 7.99%)  4.25× slower\nAlways remember that it's not just the time that has improved: memory usage is also decreased.\nUse string interpolation instead of concatenation\nSometimes you need to work directly with strings built from combining string literals with other values. You shouldn't just concatenate these strings with String#+(String) but rather use string interpolation which allows to embed expressions into a string literal: \"Hello, #{name}\" is better than \"Hello, \" +  name.to_s.\nInterpolated strings are transformed by the compiler to append to a string IO so that it automatically avoids intermediate strings. The example above translates to:\nString.build do |io|\n  io \nAvoid IO allocation for string building\nPrefer to use the dedicated String.build optimized for building strings, instead of creating an intermediate IO::Memory allocation.\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nBenchmark.ips do |bm|\n  bm.report(\"String.build\") do\n    String.build do |io|\n      99.times do\n        io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release str_benchmark.cr\nString.build 597.57k (  1.67µs) (± 5.52%)       fastest\n  IO::Memory 423.82k (  2.36µs) (± 3.76%)  1.41× slower\nAvoid creating temporary objects over and over\nConsider this program:\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n  if [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n    lines_with_language_reference += 1\n  end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\nThe above program works but has a big performance problem: on every iteration a new array is created for [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]. Remember: an array literal is just syntax sugar for creating an instance of an array and adding some values to it, and this will happen over and over on each iteration.\nThere are two ways to solve this:\n\nUse a tuple. If you use {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"} in the above program it will work the same way, but since a tuple doesn't involve heap memory it will be faster, consume less memory, and give more chances for the compiler to optimize the program.\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"}.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\nMove the array to a constant.\nLANGS = [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if LANGS.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\n\nUsing tuples is the preferred way.\nExplicit array literals in loops is one way to create temporary objects, but these can also be created via method calls. For example Hash#keys will return a new array with the keys each time it's invoked. Instead of doing that, you can use Hash#each_key, Hash#has_key? and other methods.\nUse structs when possible\nIf you declare your type as a struct instead of a class, creating an instance of it will use stack memory, which is much cheaper than heap memory and doesn't put pressure on the GC.\nYou shouldn't always use a struct, though. Structs are passed by value, so if you pass one to a method and the method makes changes to it, the caller won't see those changes, so they can be bug-prone. The best thing to do is to only use structs with immutable objects, especially if they are small.\nFor example:\n# class_vs_struct.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nclass PointClass\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nstruct PointStruct\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"class\") { PointClass.new(1, 2) }\n  x.report(\"struct\") { PointStruct.new(1, 2) }\nend\n\nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release class_vs_struct.cr\n class  28.17M (± 2.86%) 15.29× slower\nstruct 430.82M (± 6.58%)       fastest\nIterating strings\nStrings in Crystal always contain UTF-8 encoded bytes. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding: a character may be represented by several bytes, although characters in the ASCII range are always represented by a single byte. Because of this, indexing a string with String#[] is not an O(1) operation, as the bytes need to be decoded each time to find the character at the given position. There's an optimization that Crystal's String does here: if it knows all the characters in the string are ASCII, then String#[] can be implemented in O(1). However, this isn't generally true.\nFor this reason, iterating a String in this way is not optimal, and in fact has a complexity of O(n^2):\nstring = ...\nwhile i \nThere's a second problem with the above: computing the size of a String is also slow, because it's not simply the number of bytes in the string (the bytesize). However, once a String's size has been computed, it is cached.\nThe way to improve performance in this case is to either use one of the iteration methods (each_char, each_byte, each_codepoint), or use the more low-level Char::Reader struct. For example, using each_char:\nstring = ...\nstring.each_char do |char|\n  # ...\nend\n\n"},"guides/concurrency.html":{"url":"guides/concurrency.html","title":"Concurrency","keywords":"","body":"Concurrency\nConcurrency vs. Parallelism\nThe definitions of \"concurrency\" and \"parallelism\" sometimes get mixed up, but they are not the same.\nA concurrent system is one that can be in charge of many tasks, although not necessarily it is executing them at the same time. You can think of yourself being in the kitchen cooking: you chop an onion, put it to fry, and while it's being fried you chop a tomato, but you are not doing all of those things at the same time: you distribute your time between those tasks. Parallelism would be to stir fry onions with one hand while with the other one you chop a tomato.\nAt the moment of this writing, Crystal has concurrency support but not parallelism: several tasks can be executed, and a bit of time will be spent on each of these, but two code paths are never executed at the same exact time.\nA Crystal program executes in a single operating system thread, except the Garbage Collector (GC) which implements a concurrent mark-and-sweep (currently Boehm GC).\nFibers\nTo achieve concurrency, Crystal has fibers. A fiber is in a way similar to an operating system thread except that it's much more lightweight and its execution is managed internally by the process. So, a program will spawn multiple fibers and Crystal will make sure to execute them when the time is right.\nEvent loop\nFor everything I/O related there's an event loop. Some time-consuming operations are delegated to it, and while the event loop waits for that operation to finish the program can continue executing other fibers. A simple example of this is waiting for data to come through a socket.\nChannels\nCrystal has Channels inspired by CSP. They allow communicating data between fibers without sharing memory and without having to worry about locks, semaphores or other special structures.\nExecution of a program\nWhen a program starts, it fires up a main fiber that will execute your top-level code. There, one can spawn many other fibers. The components of a program are:\n\nThe Runtime Scheduler, in charge of executing all fibers when the time is right.\nThe Event Loop, which is just another fiber, being in charge of async tasks, like for example files, sockets, pipes, signals and timers (like doing a sleep).\nChannels, to communicate data between fibers. The Runtime Scheduler will coordinate fibers and channels for their communication.\nGarbage Collector: to clean up \"no longer used\" memory.\n\nA Fiber\nA fiber is an execution unit that is more lightweight than a thread. It's a small object that has an associated stack of 8MB, which is what is usually assigned to an operating system thread.\nFibers, unlike threads, are cooperative. Threads are pre-emptive: the operating system might interrupt a thread at any time and start executing another one. A fiber must explicitly tell the Runtime Scheduler to switch to another fiber. For example if there's I/O to be waited on, a fiber will tell the scheduler \"Look, I have to wait for this I/O to be available, you continue executing other fibers and come back to me when that I/O is ready\".\nThe advantage of being cooperative is that a lot of the overhead of doing a context switch (switching between threads) is gone.\nA Fiber is much more lightweight than a thread: even though it's assigned 8MB, it starts with a small stack of 4KB.\nOn a 64-bit machine it lets us spawn millions and millions of fibers. In a 32-bit machine we can only spawn 512 fibers, which is not a lot. But because 32-bit machines are starting to become obsolete, we'll bet on the future and focus more on 64-bit machines.\nThe Runtime Scheduler\nThe scheduler has a queue of:\n\nFibers ready to be executed: for example when you spawn a fiber, it's ready to be executed.\nThe event loop: which is another fiber. When there are no other fibers ready to be executed, the event loop checks if there is any async operation that is ready, and then executes the fiber waiting for that operation. The event loop is currently implemented with libevent, which is an abstraction of other event mechanisms like epoll and kqueue.\nFibers that voluntarily asked to wait: this is done with Fiber.yield, which means \"I can continue executing, but I'll give you some time to execute other fibers if you want\".\n\nCommunicating data\nBecause at this moment there's only a single thread executing your code, accessing and modifying a class variable in different fibers will work just fine. However, once multiple threads (parallelism) is introduced in the language, it might break. That's why the recommended mechanism to communicate data is using channels and sending messages between them. Internally, a channel implements all the locking mechanisms to avoid data races, but from the outside you use them as communication primitives, so you (the user) don't have to use locks.\nSample code\nSpawning a fiber\nTo spawn a fiber you use spawn with a block:\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  socket.gets\n  # ...\nend\n\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  sleep 5.seconds\n  #  ...\nend\n\nHere we have two fibers: one reads from a socket and the other does a sleep. When the first fiber reaches the socket.gets line, it gets suspended, the Event Loop is told to continue executing this fiber when there's data in the socket, and the program continues with the second fiber. This fiber wants to sleep for 5 seconds, so the Event Loop is told to continue with this fiber in 5 seconds. If there aren't other fibers to execute, the Event Loop will wait until either of these events happen, without consuming CPU time.\nThe reason why socket.gets and sleep behave like this is because their implementations talk directly with the Runtime Scheduler and the Event Loop, there's nothing magical about it. In general, the standard library already takes care of doing all of this so you don't have to.\nNote, however, that fibers don't get executed right away. For example:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nRunning the above code will produce no output and exit immediately.\nThe reason for this is that a fiber is not executed as soon as it is spawned. So, the main fiber, the one that spawns the above fiber, finishes its execution and the program exits.\nOne way to solve it is to do a sleep:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep 1.second\n\nThis program will now print \"Hello!\" for one second and then exit. This is because the sleep call will schedule the main fiber to be executed in a second, and then executes another \"ready to execute\" fiber, which in this case is the one above.\nAnother way is this:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nThis time Fiber.yield will tell the scheduler to execute the other fiber. This will print \"Hello!\" until the standard output blocks (the system call will tell us we have to wait until the output is ready), and then execution continues with the main fiber and the program exits. Here the standard output might never block so the program will continue executing forever.\nIf we want to execute the spawned fiber for ever, we can use sleep without arguments:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep\n\nOf course the above program can be written without spawn at all, just with a loop. sleep is more useful when spawning more than one fiber.\nSpawning a call\nYou can also spawn by passing a method call instead of a block. To understand why this is useful, let's look at this example:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThe above program prints \"10\" ten times. The problem is that there's only one variable i that all spawned fibers refer to, and when Fiber.yield is executed its value is 10.\nTo solve this, we can do this:\ni = 0\nwhile i (x : Int32) do\n    spawn do\n      puts(x)\n    end\n  end\n  proc.call(i)\n  i += 1\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nNow it works because we are creating a Proc and we invoke it passing i, so the value gets copied and now the spawned fiber receives a copy.\nTo avoid all this boilerplate, the standard library provides a spawn macro that accepts a call expression and basically rewrites it to do the above. Using it, we end up with:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThis is mostly useful with local variables that change at iterations. This doesn't happen with block arguments. For example, this works as expected:\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    puts i\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nSpawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete\nWe can use a channel for this:\nchannel = Channel(Nil).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(nil)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before receive\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"After receive\"\n\nThis prints:\nBefore receive\nBefore send\nAfter receive\n\nFirst, the program spawns a fiber but doesn't execute it yet. When we invoke channel.receive, the main fiber blocks and execution continues with the spawned fiber. Then channel.send(nil) is invoked, and so execution continues at channel.receive, which was waiting for a value. Then the main fiber continues executing and finishes, so the program exits without giving the other fiber a chance to print \"After send\".\nIn the above example we used nil just to communicate that the fiber ended. We can also use channels to communicate values between fibers:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before first send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before second send\"\n  channel.send(2)\nend\n\nputs \"Before first receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1\n\nputs \"Before second receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2\n\nOutput:\nBefore first receive\nBefore first send\n1\nBefore second receive\nBefore second send\n2\n\nNote that when the program executes a receive, that fiber blocks and execution continues with the other fiber. When send is executed, execution continues with the fiber that was waiting on that channel.\nHere we are sending literal values, but the spawned fiber might compute this value by, for example, reading a file, or getting it from a socket. When this fiber will have to wait for I/O, other fibers will be able to continue executing code until I/O is ready, and finally when the value is ready and sent through the channel, the main fiber will receive it. For example:\nrequire \"socket\"\n\nchannel = Channel(String).new\n\nspawn do\n  server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080)\n  socket = server.accept\n  while line = socket.gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\nspawn do\n  while line = gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\n3.times do\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nThe above program spawns two fibers. The first one creates a TCPServer, accepts one connection and reads lines from it, sending them to the channel. There's a second fiber reading lines from standard input. The main fiber reads the first 3 messages sent to the channel, either from the socket or stdin, then the program exits. The gets calls will block the fibers and tell the Event Loop to continue from there if data comes.\nLikewise, we can wait for multiple fibers to complete execution, and gather their values:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    channel.send(i * 2)\n  end\nend\n\nsum = 0\n10.times do\n  sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90\n\nYou can, of course, use receive inside a spawned fiber:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before receive\"\n  puts channel.receive\n  puts \"After receive\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"After yield\"\n\nOutput:\nBefore yield\nBefore send\nBefore receive\n1\nAfter receive\nAfter send\nAfter yield\n\nHere channel.send is executed first, but since there's no one waiting for a value (yet), execution continues in other fibers. The second fiber is executed, there's a value on the channel, it's obtained, and execution continues, first with the first fiber, then with the main fiber, because Fiber.yield puts a fiber at the end of the execution queue.\nBuffered channels\nThe above examples use unbuffered channels: when sending a value, if a fiber is waiting on that channel then execution continues on that fiber.\nWith a buffered channel, invoking send won't switch to another fiber unless the buffer is full:\n# A buffered channel of capacity 2\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new(2)\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send 1\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before send 2\"\n  channel.send(2)\n  puts \"Before send 3\"\n  channel.send(3)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\n3.times do |i|\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nOutput:\nBefore send 1\nBefore send 2\nBefore send 3\n1\n2\nAfter send\n3\nNote that the first 2 sends are executed without switching to another fiber. However, in the third send the channel's buffer is full, so execution goes to the main fiber. Here the two values are received and the channel is depleted. At the third receive the main fiber blocks and execution goes to the other fiber, which sends more values, finishes, etc.\n"},"guides/testing.html":{"url":"guides/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing Crystal Code\nCrystal comes with a fully-featured spec library in the Spec module. It provides a structure for writing executable examples of how your code should behave.\nInspired by Rspec, it includes a domain specific language (DSL) that allows you to write examples in a way similar to plain english.\nA basic spec looks something like this:\nrequire \"spec\"\n\ndescribe Array do\n  describe \"#size\" do\n    it \"correctly reports the number of elements in the Array\" do\n      [1, 2, 3].size.should eq 3\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe \"#empty?\" do\n    it \"is true when no elements are in the array\" do\n      ([] of Int32).empty?.should be_true\n    end\n\n    it \"is false if there are elements in the array\" do\n      [1].empty?.should be_false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nAnatomy of a spec file\nTo use the spec module and DSL, you need to add require \"spec\" to your spec files. Many projects use a custom spec helper which organizes these includes.\nConcrete test cases are defined in it blocks. An optional (but strongly recommended) descriptive string states it's purpose and a block contains the main logic performing the test.\nTest cases that have been defined or outlined but are not yet expected to work can be defined using pending instead of it. They will not be run but show up in the spec report as pending.\nAn it block contains an example that should invoke the code to be tested and define what is expected of it. Each example can contain multiple expectations, but it should test only one specific behaviour.\nWhen spec is included, every object has the instance methods #should and #should_not. These methods are invoked on the value being tested with an expectation as argument. If the expectation is met, code execution continues. Otherwise the example has failed and other code in this block will not be executed.\nIn test files, specs are structured by example groups which are defined by describe and context sections. Typically a top level describe defines the outer unit (such as a class) to be tested by the spec. Further describe sections can be nested within the outer unit to specify smaller units under test (such as individual methods).\nFor unit tests, it is recommended to follow the conventions for method names: Outer describe is the name of the class, inner describe targets methods. Instance methods are prefixed with #, class methods with ..\nTo establish certain contexts - think empty array versus array with elements - the context method may be used to communicate this to the reader. It has a different name, but behaves exactly like describe.\ndescribe and context take a description as argument (which should usually be a string) and a block containing the individual specs or nested groupings.\nExpectations\nExpectations define if the value being tested (actual) matches a certain value or specific criteria.\nEquivalence, Identity and Type\nThere are methods to create expectations which test for equivalence (eq), identity (be), type (be_a), and nil (be_nil).\nNote that the identity expectation uses .same? which tests if #object_id are identical. This is only true if the expected value points to the same object instead of an equivalent one.

All specs of a project are compiled and executed through the command crystal spec.\nBy convention, specs live in the spec/ directory of a project. Spec files must end with _spec.cr to be recognizable as such by the compiler command.\nYou can compile and run specs from folder trees, individual files or specific lines in a file.\n# Run  all specs in files matching spec/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec\n\n# Run all specs in files matching spec/my/test/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/\n\n# Run all specs in spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\n\n# Run the spec or group defined in line 14 of spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr:14\n\nIf the specified line is the beginning of a describe or context section, all specs inside that group are run.\nThe default formatter outputs the file and line style command for failing specs which makes it easy to rerun just this individual spec.\nSpec helper\nMany projects use a custom spec helper file, usually named spec/spec_helper.cr.\nThis file is used to require spec and other includes like code from the project needed for every spec file. This is also a good place to define global helper methods that make writing specs easier and avoid code duplication.\n# spec/spec_helper.cr\nrequire \"spec\"\nrequire \"../src/my_project.cr\"\n\ndef create_test_object(name)\n  project = MyProject.new(option: false)\n  object = project.create_object(name)\n  object\nend\n\n# spec/my_project_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\n\ndescribe \"MyProject::Object\" do\n  it \"is created\" do\n    object = create_test_object(name)\n    object.should_not be_nil\n  end\nend\n\n"},"guides/writing_shards.html":{"url":"guides/writing_shards.html","title":"Writing Shards","keywords":"","body":"Writing Shards\nHow to write and release Crystal Shards.\nWhat's a Shard?\nSimply put, a Shard is a package of Crystal code, made to be shared-with and used-by other projects.\nIntroduction\nIn this tutorial, we'll be making a Crystal library called palindrome-example.\n\nFor those who don't know, a palindrome is a word which is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards. e.g. racecar, mom, dad, kayak, madam\n\nRequirements\nIn order to release a Crystal Shard, and follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:\n\nA working installation of the Crystal compiler\nA working installation of Git\nA GitHub account\n\nCreating the Project\nBegin by using the Crystal compiler's init lib command to create a Crystal library with the standard directory structure.\nIn your terminal: crystal init lib \ne.g.\n $  crystal init lib palindrome-example\n      create  palindrome-example/.gitignore\n      create  palindrome-example/.editorconfig\n      create  palindrome-example/LICENSE\n      create  palindrome-example/README.md\n      create  palindrome-example/.travis.yml\n      create  palindrome-example/shard.yml\n      create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/spec/spec_helper.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\nInitialized empty Git repository in //.../palindrome-example/.git/\n\n...and cd into the directory:\ne.g.\ncd palindrome-example\n\nThen add & commit to start tracking the files with Git:\n $  git add -A\n $  git commit -am \"First Commit\"\n[master (root-commit) 77bad84] First Commit\n 10 files changed, 102 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .editorconfig\n create mode 100644 .gitignore\n create mode 100644 .travis.yml\n create mode 100644 LICENSE\n create mode 100644 README.md\n create mode 100644 shard.yml\n create mode 100644 spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\n create mode 100644 spec/spec_helper.cr\n create mode 100644 src/palindrome-example.cr\n create mode 100644 src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n\nWriting the Code\nThe code you write is up to you, but how you write it impacts whether people want to use your library and/or help you maintain it.\nTesting the Code\n\nTest your code. All of it. It's the only way for anyone, including you, to know if it works.\nCrystal has a built-in testing library. Use it!\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocument your code with comments. All of it. Even the private methods.\nCrystal has a built-in documentation generator. Use it!\n\nRun crystal docs to convert your code and comments into interlinking API documentation. Open the files in the /docs/ directory with a web browser to see how your documentation is looking along the way.\nSee below for instructions on hosting your compiler-generated docs on GitHub Pages.\nOnce your documentation is ready and available, add this documentation badge below the description in your README.md so users know that it exists.\n(Be sure to replace  accordingly)\n[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-brightgreen.svg)]()\n\nWriting a README\nA good README can make or break your project.\nAwesome README is a nice curation of examples and resources on the topic.\nMost importantly, your README should explain: \n\nWhat your library is \nWhat it does\nHow to use it\n\nThis explanation should include a few examples along with subheadings.\nNOTE: Be sure to replace all instances of [your-github-name] in the Crystal-generated README template with your GitHub username.\nCoding Style\n\nIt's fine to have your own style, but sticking to some core rubrics defined by the Crystal team can help keep your code consistent, readable and usable for other developers.\nUtilize Crystal's built-in code formatter to automatically format all .cr files in a directory.\n\ne.g. \ncrystal tool format\nTo check if your code is formatted correctly, or to check if using the formatter wouldn't produce any changes, simply add --check to the end of this command. \ne.g. \ncrystal tool format --check\nSee the Travis CI section below to implement this in your build.\nWriting a shard.yml\nThe spec is your rulebook. Follow it.\nName\nYour shard.yml's name property should be concise and descriptive. \n\nSearch crystalshards.xyz to check if your name is already taken.\n\ne.g.\nname: palindrome-example\n\nDescription\nAdd a description to your shard.yml. \nA description is a single line description used to search for and find your shard.\nA description should be:\n\nInformative\nDiscoverable\n\nOptimizing\nIt's hard for anyone to use your project if they can't find it.\ncrystalshards.xyz is currently the go-to place for Crystal libraries, so that's what we'll optimize for.\nThere are people looking for the exact functionality of our library and the general functionality of our library.\ne.g. Bob needs a palindrome library, but Felipe is just looking for libraries involving text and Susan is looking for libraries involving spelling.\nOur name is already descriptive enough for Bob's search of \"palindrome\". We don't need to repeat the palindrome keyword. Instead, we'll catch Susan's search for \"spelling\" and Felipe's search for \"text\".\ndescription: |\n  A textual algorithm to tell if a word is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards.\n\nGitHub\n\nCreate a repository with the same name and description as specified in your shard.yml.\n\nAdd and commit everything:\n$ git add -A && git commit -am \"shard complete\"\n\n\nAdd the remote: (Be sure to replace  and  accordingly)\n\nNOTE: If you like, feel free to replace public with origin, or a remote name of your choosing.\n$ git remote add public https://github.com//.git\n\n\nPush it: $ git push public master\n\n\n\nGitHub Releases\nIt's good practice to do GitHub Releases.\nAdd the following markdown build badge below the description in your README to inform users what the most current release is:\n(Be sure to replace  and  accordingly)\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release//.svg)](https://github.com///releases)\n\nStart by navigating to your repository's releases page.\n\nThis can be found at https://github.com///releases\n\nClick \"Create a new release\".\nAccording to the Crystal Shards README, \n\nWhen libraries are installed from Git repositories, the repository is expected to have version tags following a semver-like format, prefixed with a v. Examples: v1.2.3, v2.0.0-rc1 or v2017.04.1\n\nAccordingly, in the input that says tag version, type v0.1.0. Make sure this matches the version in shard.yml. Title it v0.1.0 and write a short description for the release.\nClick \"Publish release\" and you're done!\nYou'll now notice that the GitHub Release badge has updated in your README.\nFollow Semantic Versioning and create a new release every time your push new code to master.\nTravis CI and .travis.yml\nIf you haven't already, sign up for Travis CI.\nInsert the following markdown build badge below the description in your README.md:\n(be sure to replace  and  accordingly)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org//.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org//)\n\nBuild badges are a simple way to tell people whether your Travis CI build passes.\nAdd the following lines to your .travis.yml:\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nThis tells Travis CI to run your tests. \nAccordingly with the outcome of this command, Travis CI will return a build status of \"passed\", \"errored\", \"failed\" or \"canceled\".\nIf you want to verify that all your code has been formatted with crystal tool format, add a script for crystal tool format --check. If the code is not formatted correctly, this will break the build just as failing tests would.\ne.g.\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal tool format --check\n\nCommit and push to GitHub.\nFollow these guidelines to get your repo up & running on Travis CI.\nOnce you're up and running, and the build is passing, the build badge will update in your README.\nHosting your docs on GitHub-Pages\nAdd the following script to your .travis.yml:\n  - crystal docs\n\nThis tells Travis CI to generate your documentation.\nNext, add the following lines to your .travis.yml.\n(Be sure to replace all instances of  accordingly)\ndeploy:\n  provider: pages\n  skip_cleanup: true\n  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN\n  project_name: \n  on:\n    branch: master\n  local_dir: docs\n\nSet the Environment Variable, GITHUB_TOKEN, with your personal access token.\nIf you've been following along, your .travis.yml file should look something like this:\nlanguage: crystal\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal docs\ndeploy:\n  provider: pages\n  skip_cleanup: true\n  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN\n  project_name: \n  on:\n    branch: master\n  local_dir: docs\n\nClick Here for the official documentation on deploying to GitHub-Pages with Travis CI.\n"}}}
