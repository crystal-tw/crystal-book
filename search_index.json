程式的入口就是程式碼本身，我們不需要像部分其他的程式語言一樣再另外定義所謂的 main 函數。\n接下來我們還有另外兩個簡單的範例可以讓我們更加熟悉 Crystal：\n\nHTTP

Line Interface (CLI) Application\n開發者們時常會開發一些有趣的命令列應用程式，所以我們也來使用 Crystal 打造我們的第一個命令列應用程式看看吧 ：）\n我們把建構一個命令列應用程式分成兩個主要的部分：\n\n輸入\n輸出\n\n輸入\n這個部分會包含下列兩個項目：\n\n傳遞至應用程式的參數\n請求使用者輸入\n\n參數\n如何讓我們的應用程式判斷傳遞進來的參數是一個很常見的問題。 打個比方，我們可以執行 crystal -v 並得到下面的結果：\n$ crystal -v\nCrystal 0.31.1 (2019-10-02)\n\nLLVM: 8.0.1\nDefault target: x86_64-apple-macosx\n\n或是我們執行 crystal -h，這時 Crystal 便會顯示所有的參數列表以及如何使用他們。\n那麼，現在的問題是：「我們需要自己實作一個參數剖析器嗎？」\n答案是……否！Crystal 已經幫我們準備好了一個方便的剖析器 —— OptionParser —— 來協助我們。\n讓我們來試試看如果搭配上了這個方便的剖析器會變成什麼樣子吧！\n假設我們一開始只需要以下兩個參數：\n\n-v / --version：顯示應用程式版本\n-h / --help：顯示應用程式說明\n\n# 檔案：help.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\nOptionParser.parse do |parser|\n  parser.banner = \"歡迎使用五六不能亡應用程式！\"\n\n  parser.on \"-v\", \"--version\", \"顯示版本\" do\n    puts \"1.0 版\"\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-h\", \"--help\", \"顯示說明\" do\n    puts parser\n    exit\n  end\nend\n\n「什麼？這樣就結束了嗎？這是什麼黑魔法……」初次體驗到 Crystal 魔力的我也不由得發出了這樣的讚嘆。\n當我們的應用程式開始執行時，傳遞給 OptionParser#parse 的區塊就會被執行。\n在這個區塊裡，我們定義了所有的參數，並且剖析器會在這個區塊執行結束後對傳遞給此應用程式的參數進行判斷，一旦它發現了哪個參數符合了我們透過 parser#on 所設定的條件，它將會去執行對應的區塊。\n關於 OptionParser 的所有資訊我們都可以透過官方 API 文件來取得，並且可以在那邊找到對應的實作程式碼來發現其實這一切都不是什麼黑魔法，只是 Crystal 的貼心小設計而已。\n現在，我們有兩種方式來透過編譯器執行我們的應用程式：\n\n建置執行檔後執行\n直接透過編譯器編譯並執行\n\n這裡我們先採用後者的方式：\n$ crystal ./help.cr -- -h\n\n歡迎使用五六不能亡應用程式！\n    -v, --version                    顯示版本\n    -h, --help                       顯示說明\n\n接下來我們就可以為這個應用程式加入一些炫炮的功能：\n在預設情況下（即不帶任何參數時），這個應用程式會輸出所有的 5566 成員姓名。但如果我們加上了 -f/--first-name 參數，那麼就會只顯示他們姓名中的名子的部分：\n# 檔案：double_five_double_six.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\ndouble_five_double_six = [\n  \"孫協志\",\n  \"王仁甫\",\n  \"許孟哲\",\n  \"王少偉\",\n  \"彭康育\"\n]\nfirst =

檔案：let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"歡迎來到 5566 KTV\"\nputs \"請輸入想讓 56 唱出來的歌詞\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\nputs \"5566 正在唱： 🎵#{user_input}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\n使用 gets 方法會暫時停止應用程式的執行直到使用者結束了他的輸入（也就是按下 Enter 按鍵）。\n當使用者按下了 Enter，程式就會繼續執行並把剛剛使用者輸入的值放入 user_input 中。\n但如果使用者沒有輸入任何的值呢？\n這時候我們就必須分成兩種情況來討論：\n\n當使用者只輸入了 Enter 的時候，我們會得到一個空的字串；\n當使用者取消了輸入（例如按下了 Ctrl+D）時，我們會得到一個 Nil 值\n\n為了比較好地理解到底會發生什麼事情，我們這邊來做一個示範，假設我們想讓歌手唱出來的歌聲都得更變大聲點：\n# 檔案：let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"歡迎來到 5566 KTV\"\nputs \"請輸入想讓 56 唱出來的歌詞\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\nputs \"5566 正在唱： 🎵#{user_input.upcase}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\n當我們嘗試執行的時候就會得到 Crystal 這樣跟我們抱怨：\n$ crystal ./let_it_cli.cr\nShowing last frame. Use --error-trace for full trace.\n\nIn let_it_cli.cr:5:24\n\n 5 | puts \"5566 正在唱： 🎵#{user_input.upper_case}\n                            ^---------\nError: undefined method 'upper_case' for Nil (compile-time type is (String | Nil))\n\n啊哈，其實這裡的使用者輸入是一個 String | Nil 的聯合型別，所以我們必須分別針對 Nil 跟空字串來個別做處理：\n# 檔案：let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"歡迎來到 5566 KTV\"\nputs \"請輸入想讓 56 唱出來的歌詞\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\n\nexit if user_input.nil? # Ctrl+D\n\ndefault_lyrics = \"Hu~ Hu~ Ah I~\" \\\n                 \" / \" \\\n                 \"Hu~ Hu~ Ah I~\"\n\nlyrics = user_input.presence || default_lyrics\n\nputs \"5566 正在唱： 🎵#{lyrics.upcase}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\n輸出\n現在我們來專注到另一個主題上：應用程式的輸出。\n儘管我們的程式已經會顯示一些訊息了，但我們可以做的更好，讓我們來讓這個程式活起來（例如加一點顏色！）。\n為了讓輸出添加一些色彩，我們會使用 Colorize 模組來幫我們的忙。\n下面是一個稍微簡單一點的程式，並且已經帶有一些色彩了！我們把字體變成黃色，而讓背景呈現黑色：\n# 檔案：yellow_cli.cr\nrequire \"colorize\"\n\nputs \"歡迎來到 #{\"5566\".colorize(:yellow).on(:black)} KTV\"\n\n很簡單吧！如果我們想要把這個效果放在剖析器的說明裡面的話，我們只要直接放進 parser.banner 裡面就可以了：\n  parser.banner = \"歡迎來到 #{\"5566\".colorize(:yellow).on(:black)} KTV\"\n\n我們剛剛的 KTV 程式顯然需要一些這樣的裝飾，我們來讓文字會閃爍好了：\n# 檔案：let_it_cli.cr\nrequire \"colorize\"\n\nputs \"歡迎來到 5566 KTV\"\nputs \"請輸入想讓 56 唱出來的歌詞\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\n\nexit if user_input.nil? # Ctrl+D\n\ndefault_lyrics = \"Hu~ Hu~ Ah I~\" \\\n                 \" / \" \\\n                 \"Hu~ Hu~ Ah I~\"\n\nlyrics = user_input.presence || default_lyrics\n\nputs \"5566 正在唱： #{\"🎵#{user_input}🎶🎸🥁\".colorize.mode(:blink)}\"\n\n如此這般，我們就可以來執行看看新的程式是不是會讓歌詞產生什麼美妙的變化～\n至此，我們已經打造了兩個酷炫的命令列應用程式了！\n如果想知道更多可以使用的顏色以及更多的文字裝飾的話，可以參閱 Colorize 的 API 文件。\n測試\n就像其他的應用程式一樣，我們也會需要為了各種不同的功能寫點測試。\n到目前爲止，我們把所有的邏輯都跟 OptionParser 綁在一起，所以我們第一件要做的事情應該是重構我們的程式碼，將關鍵部分抽離出來並獨立成可以被引入的檔案們，再來我們就可以針對個別的邏輯或檔案撰寫測試了！不過這部分就留下來給各位作為練習吧，仔細想想看改如何重構以及撰寫測試呢？\n使用 Readline 及 NCurses\n如果我們想要打造更複雜的命令列應用程式的話，可以使用更多其他的函式庫來幫助我們。例如這兩個很有名的函式庫：Readline 以及 NCurses。\n從 GNU Readline 函式庫的文件中就可以看到，Readline 提供一系列讓使用者編輯命令列的功能。Readline 有一些很厲害的功能，例如：檔案名稱自動完成、自訂自動完成方法、按鍵綁定等。\n如果我們想要嘗試看看的話，可以透過 crystal-lang/crystal-readline 這個 Shard 包裝好的 API 來使用 Readline。\n至於 NCurses（New Curses）則是提供開發者在終端機中建構圖形化的界面，就如果它的名字那樣，這是由 Curses 函式庫（原本被用來打造一個叫做 Rouge 的文字地下城冒險遊戲）改進而來。\n這裡也有一堆與 NCurses 有關的 Shards 來提供我們在 Crystal 中使用它的方法。\n對了，這一章也就到此為止，希望大家玩的愉快 😎🎶\n"},"the_shards_command/":{"url":"the_shards_command/","title":"The shards command","keywords":"","body":"The shards command\nCrystal is typically accompanied by Shards, its dependency manager.\nIt manages dependencies for Crystal projects and libraries with reproducible\ninstalls across computers and systems.\nInstallation\nShards is usually distributed with Crystal itself. Alternatively, a separate shards package may be available for your system.\nTo install from source, download or clone the repository and run make CRFLAGS=--release. The compiled binary is in bin/shards and should be added to PATH.\nUsage\nshards requires the presence of a shard.yml file in the project folder (working directory). This file describes the project and lists dependencies that are required to build it.\nA default file can be created by running shards init.\nThe file's contents are explained in the Writing a Shard guide and a detailed description of the file format is provided by the shard.yml specification.\nRunning shards install resolves and installs the specified dependencies.\nThe installed versions are written into a shard.lock file for using the exact same dependency versions when running shards install again.\nIf your shard builds an application, both shard.yml and shard.lock should be checked into version control to provide reproducible dependency installs.\nIf it is only a library for other shards to depend on, shard.lock should not be checked in, only shard.yml. It's good advice to add it to .gitignore (the crystal init does this automatically when initializing a lib repository).\nShards commands\nshards [...] []\n\nIf no command is given, install will be run by default.\n\nshards build: Builds an executable\nshards check: Verifies dependencies are installed\nshards init: Generates a new shard.yml\nshards install: Resolves and installs dependencies\nshards list: Lists installed dependencies\nshards prune: Removes unused dependencies\nshards update: Resolves and updates dependencies\nshards version: Shows version of a shard\n\nTo see the available options for a particular command, use --help after a command.\nCommon options:\n\n--version: Prints the version of shards.\n-h, --help: Prints usage synopsis.\n--no-color: Disabled colored output.\n--production: Runs in release mode. Development dependencies won't be installed and only locked dependencies will be installed. Commands will fail if dependencies in shard.yml and shard.lock are out of sync (used by install, update, check and list command)\n-q, --quiet: Decreases the log verbosity, printing only warnings and errors.\n-v, --verbose: Increases the log verbosity, printing all debug statements.\n\nshards build\nshards build [] [...]\n\nBuilds the specified targets in bin path.

If not already present, generates a shard.lock file from resolved dependencies, locking version\nnumbers or Git commits.\nReads and enforces locked versions and commits if a shard.lock file is present. The install command may fail if a locked version doesn't match a requirement, but may succeed if a new dependency was added, as long as it doesn't generate a conflict, thus generating a new shard.lock file.\nshards list\nshards list\n\nLists the installed dependencies and their versions.\nshards prune\nshards prune\n\nRemoves unused dependencies from lib folder.\nshards update\nshards update\n\nResolves and updates all dependencies into the lib folder again, whatever the locked versions and commits in the shard.lock file.

Otherwise the compiler will populate them with default values. Their values can be inspected using crystal env.\n\nCRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR: Defines path where Crystal caches partial compilation results for faster subsequent builds. This path is also used to temporarily store executables when Crystal programs are run with crystal run rather than crystal build.\nDefault value is the first directory that either exists or can be created of ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/crystal (if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined), ${HOME}/.cache/crystal, ${HOME}/.crystal, ./.crystal.

It accepts a single argument, a string literal, and it can come in many flavors.\nOnce a file is required, the compiler remembers its absolute path and later requires of that same file will be ignored.\nrequire \"filename\"\nThis looks up \"filename\" in the require path.\nBy default the require path is the location of the standard library that comes with the compiler, and the \"lib\" directory relative to the current working directory (given by pwd in a Unix shell). These are the only places that are looked up.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found in the require path, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found with a directory \"src\" in it and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found with a directory \"src\" in it and it contains a directory named \"filename\" directly underneath it with a \"filename.cr\" file inside it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThe second rule means that in addition to having this:\n- project\n  - src\n    - file\n      - sub1.cr\n      - sub2.cr\n    - file.cr (requires \"./file/*\")\nyou can have it like this:\n- project\n  - src\n    - file\n      - file.cr (requires \"./*\")\n      - sub1.cr\n      - sub2.cr\nwhich might be a bit cleaner depending on your taste.\nThe third rule is very convenient because of the typical directory structure of a project:\n- project\n  - lib\n    - foo\n      - src\n        - foo.cr\n    - bar\n      - src\n        - bar.cr\n  - src\n    - project.cr\n  - spec\n    - project_spec.cr\nThat is, inside \"lib/{project}\" each project's directory exists (src, spec, README.md and so on)\nFor example, if you put require \"foo\" in project.cr and run crystal src/project.cr in the project's root directory, it will find foo in lib/foo/foo.cr.\nThe fourth rule is the second rule applied to the third rule.\nIf you run the compiler from somewhere else, say the src folder, lib will not be in the path and require \"foo\" can't be resolved.\nrequire \"./filename\"\nThis looks up \"filename\" relative to the file containing the require expression.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found relative to the current file, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThis relative is mostly used inside a project to refer to other files inside it. It is also used to refer to code from specs:\n# in spec/project_spec.cr\nrequire \"../src/project\"\n\nOther forms\nIn both cases you can use nested names and they will be looked up in nested directories:\n\nrequire \"foo/bar/baz\" will lookup \"foo/bar/baz.cr\", \"foo/bar/baz/baz.cr\", \"foo/src/bar/baz.cr\" or \"foo/src/bar/baz/baz.cr\" in the require path.\nrequire \"./foo/bar/baz\" will lookup \"foo/bar/baz.cr\" or \"foo/bar/baz/baz.cr\" relative to the current file.\n\nYou can also use \"../\" to access parent directories relative to the current file, so require \"../../foo/bar\" works as well.\nIn all of these cases you can use the special * and ** suffixes:\n\nrequire \"foo/*\" will require all \".cr\" files below the \"foo\" directory, but not below directories inside \"foo\".\nrequire \"foo/**\" will require all \".cr\" files below the \"foo\" directory, and below directories inside \"foo\", recursively.\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/types_and_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/types_and_methods.html","title":"Types and methods","keywords":"","body":"Types and methods\nThe next sections will assume you know what object oriented programming is, as well as the concepts of classes and methods.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/everything_is_an_object.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/everything_is_an_object.html","title":"Everything is an object","keywords":"","body":"Everything is an object\nIn Crystal everything is an object.

A Person has a name and an age. In the \"Everything is an object\" section we said that an object has a type and responds to some methods, which is the only way to interact with objects, so we'll need both name and age methods. We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an at (@) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero. We code the \"come into existence\" part with a special initialize method, which is normally called a constructor:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def name\n    @name\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nNow we can create people like this:\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.name # => \"John\"\njohn.age  # => 0\n\npeter.name # => \"Peter\"\n\n(If you wonder why we needed to specify that name is a String but we didn't need to do it for age, check the global type inference algorithm)\nNote that we create a Person with new but we defined the initialization in an initialize method, not in a new method. Why is this so?\nThe answer is that when we defined an initialize method Crystal defined a new method for us, like this:\nclass Person\n  def self.new(name : String)\n    instance = Person.allocate\n    instance.initialize(name)\n    instance\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, note the self.new notation. This is a class method that belongs to the class Person, not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do Person.new.\nSecond, allocate is a low-level class method that creates an uninitialized object of the given type. It basically allocates the necessary memory for the object, then initialize is invoked on it and finally the instance is returned. You generally never invoke allocate, as it is unsafe, but that's the reason why new and initialize are related.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html","title":"Methods and instance variables","keywords":"","body":"Methods and instance variables\nWe can simplify our constructor by using a shorter syntax for assigning a method argument to an instance variable:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nRight now, we can't do much with a person aside from create it with a name. Its age will always be zero. So lets add a method that makes a person become older:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\n\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.age # => 0\n\njohn.become_older\njohn.age # => 1\n\npeter.age # => 0\n\nMethod names begin with a lowercase letter and, as a convention, only use lowercase letters, underscores and numbers.\nGetters and setters\nThe Crystal Standard Library provides macros which simplify the definition of getter and setter methods:\nclass Person\n  property age\n  getter name : String\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\njohn.age = 32\njohn.age # => 32\n\nFor more information on getter and setter macros, see the standard library documentation for Object#getter, Object#setter, and Object#property.\nAs a side note, we can define become_older inside the original Person definition, or in a separate definition: Crystal combines all definitions into a single class. The following works just fine:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nRedefining methods, and previous_def\nIf you redefine a method, the last definition will take precedence.\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age # => 2\n\nYou can invoke the previously redefined method with previous_def:\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    previous_def\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age # => 3\n\nWithout arguments or parentheses, previous_def receives the same arguments as the method's arguments.

However, some restrictions are required.\nConsider a class definition like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWe can quickly see that @age is an integer, but we don't know the type of @name. The compiler could infer its type from all uses of the Person class. However, doing so has a few issues:\n\nThe type is not obvious for a human reading the code: they would also have to check all uses of Person to find this out.\nSome compiler optimizations, like having to analyze a method just once, and incremental compilation, are nearly impossible to do.\n\nAs a code base grows, these issues gain more relevance: understanding a project becomes harder, and compile times become unbearable.\nFor this reason, Crystal needs to know, in an obvious way (as obvious as to a human), the types of instance and class variables.\nThere are several ways to let Crystal know this.\nWith type restrictions\nThe easiest, but probably most tedious, way is to use explicit type restrictions.\nclass Person\n  @name : String\n  @age : Int32\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWithout type restrictions\nIf you omit an explicit type restriction, the compiler will try to infer the type of instance and class variables using a bunch of syntactic rules.\nFor a given instance/class variable, when a rule can be applied and a type can be guessed, the type is added to a set. When no more rules can be applied, the inferred type will be the union of those types. Additionally, if the compiler infers that an instance variable isn't always initialized, it will also include the Nil type.\nThe rules are many, but usually the first three are most used. There's no need to remember them all. If the compiler gives an error saying that the type of an instance variable can't be inferred you can always add an explicit type restriction.\nThe following rules only mention instance variables, but they apply to class variables as well. They are:\n1. Assigning a literal value\nWhen a literal is assigned to an instance variable, the literal's type is added to the set. All literals have an associated type.\nIn the following example, @name is inferred to be String and @age to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"John Doe\"\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nThis rule, and every following rule, will also be applied in methods other than initialize. For example:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number = 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil: Int32 because 42 was assigned to it, and Nil because it wasn't assigned in all of the class' initialize methods.\n2. Assigning the result of invoking the class method new\nWhen an expression like Type.new(...) is assigned to an instance variable, the type Type is added to the set.\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.new(\"somewhere\")\n  end\nend\n\nThis also is applied to generic types. Here @values is inferred to be Array(Int32).\nclass Something\n  def initialize\n    @values = Array(Int32).new\n  end\nend\n\nNote: a new method might be redefined by a type. In that case the inferred type will be the one returned by new, if it can be inferred using some of the next rules.\n3. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a type restriction\nIn the following example @name is inferred to be String because the method argument name has a type restriction of type String, and that argument is assigned to @name.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nNote that the name of the method argument is not important; this works as well:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(obj : String)\n    @name = obj\n  end\nend\n\nUsing the shorter syntax to assign an instance variable from a method argument has the same effect:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nAlso note that the compiler doesn't check whether a method argument is reassigned a different value:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    name = 1\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, the compiler will still infer @name to be String, and later will give a compile time error, when fully typing that method, saying that Int32 can't be assigned to a variable of type String. Use an explicit type restriction if @name isn't supposed to be a String.\n4. Assigning the result of a class method that has a return type restriction\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address, because the class method Address.unknown has a return type restriction of Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  def self.unknown : Address\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nIn fact, the above code doesn't need the return type restriction in self.unknown. The reason is that the compiler will also look at a class method's body and if it can apply one of the previous rules (it's a new method, or it's a literal, etc.) it will infer the type from that expression. So, the above can be simply written like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  # No need for a return type restriction here\n  def self.unknown\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis extra rule is very convenient because it's very common to have \"constructor-like\" class methods in addition to new.\n5. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a default value\nIn the following example, because the default value of name is a string literal, and it's later assigned to @name, String will be added to the set of inferred types.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name = \"John Doe\")\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nThis of course also works with the short syntax:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name = \"John Doe\")\n  end\nend\n\nThe default value can also be a Type.new(...) method or a class method with a return type restriction.\n6. Assigning the result of invoking a lib function\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the return type when assigning it to an instance variable.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = LibPerson.compute_default_age\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age : Int32\nend\n\n7. Using an out lib expression\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the out argument's type, which should be a pointer type, and use the dereferenced type as a guess.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    LibPerson.compute_default_age(out @age)\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age(age_ptr : Int32*)\nend\n\nOther rules\nThe compiler will try to be as smart as possible to require less explicit type restrictions. For example, if assigning an if expression, type will be inferred from the then and else branches:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = some_condition ? 1 : 2\n  end\nend\n\nBecause the if above (well, technically a ternary operator, but it's similar to an if) has integer literals, @age is successfully inferred to be Int32 without requiring a redundant type restriction.\nAnother case is || and ||=:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number ||= 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above example @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil. This is very useful for lazily initialized variables.\nConstants will also be followed, as it's pretty simple for the compiler (and a human) to do so.\nclass SomeObject\n  DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER = 42\n\n  def initialize(@lucky_number = DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER)\n  end\nend\n\nHere rule 5 (argument's default value) is used, and because the constant resolves to an integer literal, @lucky_number is inferred to be Int32.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html","title":"Union types","keywords":"","body":"Union types\nThe type of a variable or expression can consist of multiple types.

This is expressed as the special return type NoReturn.\nTypical examples for non-returning methods and keywords are return, exit, raise, next, and break.\nThis is for example useful for deconstructing union types:\nstring = STDIN.gets\ntypeof(string)                        # => String?\ntypeof(raise \"Empty input\")           # => NoReturn\ntypeof(string || raise \"Empty input\") # => String\nThe compiler recognizes that in case string is Nil, the right hand side of the expression string || raise will be evaluated. Since typeof(raise \"Empty input\") is NoReturn the execution would not return to the current scope in that case. That leaves only String as resulting type of the expression.\nEvery expression whose code paths all result in NoReturn will be NoReturn as well. NoReturn does not show up in a union type because it would essentially be included in every expression's type. It is only used when an expression will never return to the current scope.\nNoReturn can be explicitly set as return type of a method or function definition but will usually be inferred by the compiler.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html","title":"Method arguments","keywords":"","body":"Method arguments\nThis is the formal specification of method and call arguments.\nComponents of a method definition\nA method definition consists of:\n\nrequired and optional positional arguments\nan optional splat argument, whose name can be empty\nrequired and optional named arguments\nan optional double splat argument\n\nFor example:\ndef foo(\n  # These are positional arguments:\n  x, y, z = 1,\n  # This is the splat argument:\n  *args,\n  # These are the named arguments:\n  a, b, c = 2,\n  # This is the double splat argument:\n  **options\n)\nend\n\nEach one of them is optional, so a method can do without the double splat, without the splat, without keyword arguments and without positional arguments.\nComponents of a method call\nA method call also has some parts:\nfoo(\n  # These are positional arguments\n  1, 2,\n  # These are named arguments\n  a: 1, b: 2\n)\n\nAdditionally, a call argument can have a splat (*) or double splat (**). A splat expands a Tuple into positional arguments, while a double splat expands a NamedTuple into named arguments. Multiple argument splats and double splats are allowed.\nHow call arguments are matched to method arguments\nWhen invoking a method, the algorithm to match call arguments to method arguments is:\n\nFirst positional arguments are matched with positional method arguments. The number of these must be at least the number of positional arguments without a default value. If there's a splat method argument with a name (the case without a name is explained below), more positional arguments are allowed and they are captured as a tuple. Positional arguments never match past the splat method argument.\nThen named arguments are matched, by name, with any argument in the method (it can be before or after the splat method argument). If an argument was already filled by a positional argument then it's an error.\nExtra named arguments are placed in the double splat method argument, as a NamedTuple, if it exists, otherwise it's an error.\n\nWhen a splat method argument has no name, it means no more positional arguments can be passed, and next arguments must be passed as named arguments. For example:\n# Only one positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1        # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2     # Error: wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1)\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\n\nBut even if a splat method argument has a name, arguments that follow it must be passed as named arguments:\n# One or more positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *args, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1             # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2          # Error: missing argument; y\nfoo 1, 2, 3       # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo 1, y: 10      # OK\nfoo 1, 2, 3, y: 4 # OK\n\nThere's also the possibility of making a method only receive named arguments (and list them), by placing the star at the beginning:\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y)\nend\n\nfoo            # Error: missing arguments: x, y\nfoo x: 1       # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo x: 1, y: 2 # OK\n\nArguments past the star can also have default values. It means: they must be passed as named arguments, but they aren't required (so: optional named arguments):\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y = 2)\nend\n\nfoo            # Error: missing argument: x\nfoo x: 1       # OK, y is 2\nfoo x: 1, y: 3 # OK, y is 3\n\nBecause arguments (without a default value) after the splat method argument must be passed by name, two methods with different required named arguments overload:\ndef foo(*, x)\n  puts \"Passed with x: #{x}\"\nend\n\ndef foo(*, y)\n  puts \"Passed with y: #{y}\"\nend\n\nfoo x: 1 # => Passed with x: 1\nfoo y: 2 # => Passed with y: 2\n\nPositional arguments can always be matched by name:\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1, y: 2    # OK\nfoo y: 2, x: 3 # OK\n\nExternal names\nAn external name can be specified for a method argument. The external name is the one used when passing an argument as a named argument, and the internal name is the one used inside the method definition:\ndef foo(external_name internal_name)\n  # here we use internal_name\nend\n\nfoo external_name: 1\n\nThis covers two uses cases.\nThe first use case is using keywords as named arguments:\ndef plan(begin begin_time, end end_time)\n  puts \"Planning between #{begin_time} and #{end_time}\"\nend\n\nplan begin: Time.now, end: 2.days.from_now\n\nThe second use case is making a method argument more readable inside a method body:\ndef increment(value, by)\n  # OK, but reads odd\n  value + by\nend\n\ndef increment(value, by amount)\n  # Better\n  value + amount\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nCrystal supports a number of operators, with one, two or three operands.\nOperator expressions are actually parsed as method calls. For example a + b\nis semantically equivalent to a.+(b), a call to method + on a with\nargument b.\nThere are however some special rules regarding operator syntax:\n\nThe dot (.) usually put between receiver and method name\n(i.e. the operator) can be omitted.\nChained sequences of operator calls are restructured by the compiler in order\nto implement operator precedence.\nEnforcing operator precedence makes sure that an expression such as\n1 * 2 + 3 * 4 is parsed as (1 * 2) + (2 * 3) to honour regular math rules.\nRegular method names must start with a letter or underscore, but operators\nonly consist of special characters. Any method not starting with a letter or\nunderscore is an operator  method.\nAvailable operators are whitelisted in the compiler (see\nList of Operators below) which allows symbol-only method\nnames and treats them as operators, including their precedence rules.\n\nOperators are implemented like any regular method, and the standard library\noffers many implementations, for example for math expressions.\nDefining operator methods\nMost operators can be implemented as regular methods.\nOne can assign any meaning to the operators, but it is advisable to stay within\nsimilar semantics to the generic operator meaning to avoid cryptic code that is\nconfusing and behaves unexpectedly.\nA few operators are defined directly by the compiler and cannot be redefined\nin user code. Examples for this are the inversion operator !, the assignment\noperator =, combined assignment operators such as\n||= and range operators. Whether a method can be redefined is\nindicated by the colum Overloadable in the below operator tables.\nUnary operators\nUnary operators are written in prefix notation and have only a single operand.\nThus, a method implementation receives no arguments and only operates on self.\nThe following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional\nvector with a unary operator method - for vector inversion.\nstruct Vector2\n  getter x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\n\n  # Unary operator. Returns the inverted vector to `self`.\n  def - : self\n    Vector2.new(-x, -y)\n  end\nend\n\nv1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)\n-v1 # => Vector2(@x=-1, @y=-2)\n\nBinary operators\nBinary operators have two operands. Thus, a method implementation receives\nexactly one argument representing the second operand. The first operand is the\nreceiver self.\nThe following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional\nvector with a binary operator method + for vector addition.\nstruct Vector2\n  getter x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\n\n  # Binary operator. Returns *other* added to `self`.\n  def +(other : self) : self\n    Vector2.new(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n  end\nend\n\nv1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)\nv2 = Vector2.new(3, 4)\nv1 + v2 # => Vector2(@x=4, @y=6)\n\nPer convention, the return type of a binary operator should be the type of the\nfirst operand (the receiver), so that typeof(a  b) == typeof(a).\nOtherwise the assignment operator (a = b) would unintentionally change the\ntype of a.\nThere can be reasonable exceptions though. For example in the standard library\nthe float division operator / on integer types always returns Float64,\nbecause the quotient must not be limited to the value range of integers.\nTernary operators\nThe conditional operator (? :) is the only ternary\noperator.

But, on the other hand, it makes sense: classes under the same hierarchy should behave in a similar way.\nLets make John's pet talk:\njohn.pet.talk # Error: undefined method 'talk' for Animal\n\nWe get an error because the compiler now treats @pet as an Animal+, which includes Animal. And since it can't find a talk method on it, it errors.\nWhat the compiler doesn't know is that for us, Animal will never be instantiated as it doesn't make sense to instantiate one. We have a way to tell the compiler so by marking the class as abstract:\nabstract class Animal\nend\n\nNow the code compiles:\njohn.pet.talk # => \"Woof!\"\n\nMarking a class as abstract will also prevent us from creating an instance of it:\nAnimal.new # Error: can't instantiate abstract class Animal\n\nTo make it more explicit that an Animal must define a talk method, we can add it to Animal as an abstract method:\nabstract class Animal\n  # Makes this animal talk\n  abstract def talk\nend\n\nBy marking a method as abstract the compiler will check that all subclasses implement this method, even if a program doesn't use them.\nAbstract methods can also be defined in modules, and the compiler will check that including types implement them.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html","title":"Class methods","keywords":"","body":"Class methods\nClass methods are methods associated to a class or module instead of a specific instance.\nmodule CaesarCipher\n  def self.encrypt(string : String)\n    string.chars.map { |char| ((char.upcase.ord - 52) % 26 + 65).chr }.join\n  end\nend\n\nCaesarCipher.encrypt(\"HELLO\") # => \"URYYB\"\n\nClass methods are defined by prefixing the method name with the type name and a period.\ndef CaesarCipher.decrypt(string : String)\n  encrypt(string)\nend\n\nWhen they're defined inside a class or module scope it is easier to use self instead of the class name.\nClass methods can also be defined by extending a Module.\nA class method can be called under the same name as it was defined (CaesarCipher.decrypt(\"HELLO\")).\nWhen called from within the same class or module scope the receiver can be self or implicit (like encrypt(string)).\nConstructors\nConstructors are normal class methods which create a new instance of the class.\nBy default all classes in Crystal have at least one constructor called new, but they may also define other constructors with different names.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html","title":"Class variables","keywords":"","body":"Class variables\nClass variables are associated to classes instead of instances.

When inheriting you can specify an instance of the generic type, or delegate type variables:\nclass Parent(T)\nend\n\nclass Int32Child \n"},"syntax_and_semantics/structs.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/structs.html","title":"Structs","keywords":"","body":"Structs\nInstead of defining a type with class you can do so with struct:\nstruct Point\n  property x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nStructs inherit from Value so they are allocated on the stack and passed by value: when passed to methods, returned from methods or assigned to variables, a copy of the value is actually passed (while classes inherit from Reference, are allocated on the heap and passed by reference).\nTherefore structs are mostly useful for immutable data types and/or stateless wrappers of other types, usually for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient (for more details, see the performance guide).\nMutable structs are still allowed, but you should be careful when writing code involving mutability if you want to avoid surprises that are described below.\nPassing by value\nA struct is always passed by value, even when you return self from the method of that struct:\nstruct Counter\n  def initialize(@count : Int32)\n  end\n\n  def plus\n    @count += 1\n    self\n  end\nend\n\ncounter = Counter.new(0)\ncounter.plus.plus # => Counter(@x=2)\nputs counter      # => Counter(@x=1)\n\nNotice that the chained calls of plus return the expected result, but only the first call to it modifies the variable counter, as the second call operates on the copy of the struct passed to it from the first call, and this copy is discarded after the expression is executed.\nYou should also be careful when working on mutable types inside of the struct:\nclass Klass\n  property array = [\"str\"]\nend\n\nstruct Strukt\n  property array = [\"str\"]\nend\n\ndef modify(object)\n  object.array  [\"new\", \"bar\"]\nputs klass.array   # => [\"new\", \"bar\"]\n\nstrukt = Strukt.new\nputs modify(strukt) # => [\"new\", \"bar\"]\nputs strukt.array   # => [\"str\", \"foo\"]\n\nWhat happens with the strukt here:\n\nArray is passed by reference, so the reference to [\"str\"] is stored in the property of strukt\nwhen strukt is passed to modify, a copy of the strukt is passed with the reference to array inside it\nthe array referenced by array is modified (element inside it is added) by object.array \nthis is also reflected in the original strukt as it holds reference to the same array\nobject.array = [\"new\"] replaces the reference in the copy of strukt with the reference to the new array\nobject.array  appends to this newly created array\nmodify returns the reference to this new array and its content is printed\nthe reference to this new array was held only in the copy of strukt, but not in the original, so that's why the original strukt only retained the result of the first statement, but not of the other two statements\n\nKlass is a class, so it is passed by reference to modify, and object.array = [\"new\"] saves the reference to the newly created array in the original klass object, not in the copy as it was with the strukt.\nInheritance\n\nA struct implicitly inherits from Struct, which inherits from Value. A class implicitly inherits from Reference.\nA struct cannot inherit from a non-abstract struct.\n\nThe second point has a reason to it: a struct has a very well defined memory layout. For example, the above Point struct occupies 8 bytes. If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer:\n# The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point\nary = [] of Point\n\nIf Point is inherited, an array of such type should also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element should grow to accommodate that. That is certainly unexpected. So, non-abstract structs can't be inherited from. Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it is expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it.\nA struct can also include modules and can be generic, just like a class.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/constants.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/constants.html","title":"Constants","keywords":"","body":"Constants\nConstants can be declared at the top level or inside other types.

For example:\nenum Color\n  Red\n  Green\n  Blue\nend\n\nAn enum is defined with the enum keyword, followed by its name. The enum's body contains the values. Values start with the value 0 and are incremented by one. The default value can be overwritten:\nenum Color\n  Red        # 0\n  Green      # 1\n  Blue   = 5 # overwritten to 5\n  Yellow     # 6 (5 + 1)\nend\n\nEach constant in the enum has the type of the enum:\nColor::Red # :: Color\n\nTo get the underlying value you invoke value on it:\nColor::Green.value # => 1\n\nThe type of the value is Int32 by default but can be changed:\nenum Color : UInt8\n  Red\n  Green\n  Blue\nend\n\nColor::Red.value # :: UInt8\n\nOnly integer types are allowed as the underlying type.\nAll enums inherit from Enum.\nFlags enums\nAn enum can be marked with the @[Flags] attribute. This changes the default values:\n@[Flags]\nenum IOMode\n  Read  # 1\n  Write # 2\n  Async # 4\nend\n\nThe @[Flags] attribute makes the first constant's value be 1, and successive constants are multiplied by 2.\nImplicit constants, None and All, are automatically added to these enums, where None has the value 0 and All has the \"or\"ed value of all constants.\nIOMode::None.value # => 0\nIOMode::All.value  # => 7\n\nAdditionally, some Enum methods check the @[Flags] attribute. For example:\nputs(Color::Red)                    # prints \"Red\"\nputs(IOMode::Write | IOMode::Async) # prints \"Write, Async\"\n\nEnums from integers\nAn enum can be created from an integer:\nputs Color.new(1) # => prints \"Green\"\n\nValues that don't correspond to an enum's constants are allowed: the value will still be of type Color, but when printed you will get the underlying value:\nputs Color.new(10) # => prints \"10\"\n\nThis method is mainly intended to convert integers from C to enums in Crystal.\nMethods\nJust like a class or a struct, you can define methods for enums:\nenum Color\n  Red\n  Green\n  Blue\n\n  def red?\n    self == Color::Red\n  end\nend\n\nColor::Red.red?  # => true\nColor::Blue.red? # => false\n\nClass variables are allowed, but instance variables are not.\nUsage\nEnums are a type-safe alternative to Symbol. For example, an API's method can specify a type restriction using an enum type:\ndef paint(color : Color)\n  case color\n  when Color::Red\n    # ...\n  else\n    # Unusual, but still can happen\n    raise \"unknown color: #{color}\"\n  end\nend\n\npaint Color::Red\n\nThe above could also be implemented with a Symbol:\ndef paint(color : Symbol)\n  case color\n  when :red\n    # ...\n  else\n    raise \"unknown color: #{color}\"\n  end\nend\n\npaint :red\n\nHowever, if the programmer makes a typo, say :reed, the error will only be caught at runtime, while attempting to use Color::Reed will result in a compile-time error.\nThe recommended thing to do is to use enums whenever possible, only use symbols for the internal implementation of an API, and avoid symbols for public APIs.

For example:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\nThe above program prints \"Hello!\" twice, once for each yield.\nTo define a method that receives a block, simply use yield inside it and the compiler will know. You can make this more evident by declaring a dummy block argument, indicated as a last argument prefixed with ampersand (&):\ndef twice(&block)\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\nTo invoke a method and pass a block, you use do ... end or { ... }. All of these are equivalent:\ntwice() do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice { puts \"Hello!\" }\n\nThe difference between using do ... end and { ... } is that do ... end binds to the left-most call, while { ... } binds to the right-most call:\nfoo bar do\n  something\nend\n\n# The above is the same as\nfoo(bar) do\n  something\nend\n\nfoo bar { something }\n\n# The above is the same as\n\nfoo(bar { something })\n\nThe reason for this is to allow creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using do ... end to have them be read as plain English:\nopen file \"foo.cr\" do\n  something\nend\n\n# Same as:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\")) do\nend\n\nYou wouldn't want the above to be:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\") do\nend)\n\nOverloads\nTwo methods, one that yields and another that doesn't, are considered different overloads, as explained in the overloading section.\nYield arguments\nThe yield expression is similar to a call and can receive arguments. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Got 1\" and \"Got 2\".\nA curly braces notation is also available:\ntwice { |i| puts \"Got #{i}\" }\n\nYou can yield many values:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y, z|\n  puts x + y + z\nend\n\n# Output: 6\n\nA block can specify less than the arguments yielded:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y|\n  puts x + y\nend\n\n# Output: 3\n\nIt's an error specifying more block arguments than those yielded:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do |i| # Error: too many block arguments\nend\n\nEach block variable has the type of every yield expression in that position. For example:\ndef some\n  yield 1, 'a'\n  yield true, \"hello\"\n  yield 2, nil\nend\n\nsome do |first, second|\n  # first is Int32 | Bool\n  # second is Char | String | Nil\nend\n\nThe block variable second also includes the Nil type because the last yield expression didn't include a second argument.\nShort one-argument syntax\nIf a block has a single argument and invokes a method on it, the block can be replaced with the short syntax argument.\nThis:\nmethod do |argument|\n  argument.some_method\nend\n\nand\nmethod { |argument| argument.some_method }\n\ncan both be written as:\nmethod &.some_method\n\nOr like:\nmethod(&.some_method)\n\nIn either case, &.some_method is an argument passed to method.  This argument is syntactically equivalent to the block variants.  It is only syntactic sugar and does not have any performance penalty.\nIf the method has other required parameters, the short syntax argument should also be supplied in the method's argument list.\n[\"a\", \"b\"].join(\",\", &.upcase)\n\nIs equivalent to:\n[\"a\", \"b\"].join(\",\") { |s| s.upcase }\n\nArguments can be used with the short syntax argument as well:\n[\"i\", \"o\"].join(\",\", &.upcase(Unicode::CaseOptions::Turkic))\n\nOperators can be invoked too:\nmethod &.+(2)\nmethod(&.[index])\n\nyield value\nThe yield expression itself has a value: the last expression of the block. For example:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  i + 1\nend\n\nThe above prints \"2\" and \"3\".\nA yield expression's value is mostly useful for transforming and filtering values. The best examples of this are Enumerable#map and Enumerable#select:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\nary.map { |x| x + 1 }         # => [2, 3, 4]\nary.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 } # => [1, 3]\n\nA dummy transformation method:\ndef transform(value)\n  yield value\nend\n\ntransform(1) { |x| x + 1 } # => 2\n\nThe result of the last expression is 2 because the last expression of the transform method is yield, whose value is the last expression of the block.\nType restrictions\nThe type of the block in a method that uses yield can be restricted using the &block syntax. For example:\ndef transform_int(start : Int32, &block : Int32 -> Int32)\n  result = yield start\n  result * 2\nend\n\ntransform_int(3) { |x| x + 2 } # => 10\ntransform_int(3) { |x| \"foo\" } # Error: expected block to return Int32, not String\n\nbreak\nA break expression inside a block exits early from the method:\ndef thrice\n  puts \"Before 1\"\n  yield 1\n  puts \"Before 2\"\n  yield 2\n  puts \"Before 3\"\n  yield 3\n  puts \"After 3\"\nend\n\nthrice do |i|\n  if i == 2\n    break\n  end\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Before 1\" and \"Before 2\". The thrice method didn't execute the puts \"Before 3\" expression because of the break.\nbreak can also accept arguments: these become the method's return value. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice { |i| i + 1 }         # => 3\ntwice { |i| break \"hello\" } # => \"hello\"\n\nThe first call's value is 3 because the last expression of the twice method is yield, which gets the value of the block. The second call's value is \"hello\" because a break was performed.\nIf there are conditional breaks, the call's return value type will be a union of the type of the block's value and the type of the many breaks:\nvalue = twice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    break \"hello\"\n  end\n  i + 1\nend\nvalue # :: Int32 | String\n\nIf a break receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple:\nvalues = twice { break 1, 2 }\nvalues # => {1, 2}\n\nIf a break receives no arguments, it's the same as receiving a single nil argument:\nvalue = twice { break }\nvalue # => nil\n\nnext\nThe next expression inside a block exits early from the block (not the method). For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    puts \"Skipping 1\"\n    next\n  end\n\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\n# Output:\n# Skipping 1\n# Got 2\n\nThe next expression accepts arguments, and these give the value of the yield expression that invoked the block:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    next 10\n  end\n\n  i + 1\nend\n\n# Output\n# 10\n# 3\n\nIf a next receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple. If it receives no arguments it's the same as receiving a single nil argument.\nwith ... yield\nA yield expression can be modified, using the with keyword, to specify an object to use as the default receiver of method calls within the block:\nclass Foo\n  def one\n    1\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\n\n  def yield_normally\n    yield\n  end\nend\n\ndef one\n  \"one\"\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { one } # => 1\nFoo.new.yield_normally { one }  # => \"one\"\n\nUnpacking block arguments\nA block argument can specify sub-arguments enclosed in parentheses:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |(number, word)|\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThe above is simply syntax sugar of this:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |arg|\n  number = arg[0]\n  word = arg[1]\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThat means that any type that responds to [] with integers can be unpacked in a block argument.\nFor Tuple arguments you can take advantage of auto-splatting and do not need parentheses:\narray = [{1, \"one\", true}, {2, \"two\", false}]\narray.each do |number, word, bool|\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word} #{bool}\"\nend\n\nHash(K, V)#each:Nil-instance-method) passes Tuple(K, V) to the block so iterating key-value pairs works with auto-splatting:\nh = {\"foo\" => \"bar\"}\nh.each do |key, value|\n  key   # => \"foo\"\n  value # => \"bar\"\nend\n\nPerformance\nWhen using blocks with yield, the blocks are always inlined: no closures, calls or function pointers are involved. This means that this:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got: #{i}\"\nend\n\nis exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 1\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\ni = 2\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\n\nFor example, the standard library includes a times method on integers, allowing you to write:\n3.times do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\nThis looks very fancy, but is it as fast as a C for loop? The answer is: yes!\nThis is Int#times definition:\nstruct Int\n  def times\n    i = 0\n    while i \nBecause a non-captured block is always inlined, the above method invocation is exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nHave no fear using blocks for readability or code reuse, it won't affect the resulting executable performance.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html","title":"Capturing blocks","keywords":"","body":"Capturing blocks\nA block can be captured and turned into a Proc, which represents a block of code with an associated context: the closured data.\nTo capture a block you must specify it as a method's block argument, give it a name and specify the input and output types.

For example:\ndef foo\n  yield\nend\n\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nThe compiler knows that after the block, x can be Int32 or String (it could know that it will always be String because the method always yields; this may improve in the future).\nIf x is assigned something else after the block, the compiler knows the type changed:\nx = 1\nfoo do\n  x = \"hello\"\nend\nx # : Int32 | String\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Char\n\nHowever, if x is closured by a proc, the type is always the mixed type of all assignments to it:\ndef capture(&block)\n  block\nend\n\nx = 1\ncapture { x = \"hello\" }\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Int32 | String | Char\n\nThis is because the captured block could have been potentially stored in a class or instance variable and invoked in a separate thread in between the instructions. The compiler doesn't do an exhaustive analysis of this: it just assumes that if a variable is captured by a proc, the time of that proc invocation is unknown.\nThis also happens with regular proc literals, even if it's evident that the proc wasn't invoked or stored:\ndef capture(&block)\n  block\nend\n\nx = 1\n->{ x = \"hello\" }\n\nx = 'a'\nx # : Int32 | String | Char\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/alias.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/alias.html","title":"alias","keywords":"","body":"別名 (alias)\n透過 alias 我們可以賦予型別一個不同的名子：\nalias PInt32 = Pointer(Int32)\n\nptr = PInt32.malloc(1) # : Pointer(Int32)\n\n每當別名被使用時，編譯器都將其替換回原來的型別。\n使用別名來避免撰寫過長的型別名稱時非常方便，別名也能夠用來描述遞迴型別。\nalias RecArray = Array(Int32) | Array(RecArray)\n\nary = [] of RecArray\nary.push [1, 2, 3]\nary.push ary\nary # => [[1, 2, 3], [...]]\n\nJson 是一個常見的遞迴型別範例：\nmodule Json\n  alias Type = Nil |\n               Bool |\n               Int64 |\n               Float64 |\n               String |\n               Array(Type) |\n               Hash(String, Type)\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html","title":"Exception handling","keywords":"","body":"Exception handling\nCrystal's way to do error handling is by raising and rescuing exceptions.\nRaising exception\nYou raise exceptions by invoking a top-level raise method. Unlike other keywords, raise is a regular method with two overloads: one accepting a String and another accepting an Exception instance:\nraise \"OH NO!\"\nraise Exception.new(\"Some error\")\n\nThe String version just creates a new Exception instance with that message.\nOnly Exception instances or subclasses can be raised.\nDefining custom exceptions\nTo define a custom exception type, just subclass from Exception:\nclass MyException \nYou can, as always, define a constructor for your exception or just use the default one.\nRescuing exceptions\nTo rescue any exception use a begin ... rescue ... end expression:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue\n  puts \"Rescued!\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued!\n\nTo access the rescued exception you can specify a variable in the rescue clause:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue ex\n  puts ex.message\nend\n\n# Output: OH NO!\n\nTo rescue just one type of exception (or any of its subclasses):\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException\n\nAnd to access it, use a syntax similar to type restrictions:\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue ex : MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException: #{ex.message}\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException: OH NO!\n\nMultiple rescue clauses can be specified:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex1 : MyException\n  # only MyException...\nrescue ex2 : MyOtherException\n  # only MyOtherException...\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nYou can also rescue multiple exception types at once by specifying a union type:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex : MyException | MyOtherException\n  # only MyException or MyOtherException\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nelse\nAn else clause is executed only if no exceptions were rescued:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute this if an exception is raised\nelse\n  # execute this if an exception isn't raised\nend\n\nAn else clause can only be specified if at least one rescue clause is specified.\nensure\nAn ensure clause is executed at the end of a begin ... end or begin ... rescue ... end expression regardless of whether an exception was raised or not:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts \"Cleanup...\"\nend\n\n# Will print \"Cleanup...\" after invoking something_dangerous,\n# regardless of whether it raised or not\n\nOr:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # ...\nelse\n  # ...\nensure\n  # this will always be executed\nend\n\nensure clauses are usually used for clean up, freeing resources, etc.\nShort syntax form\nException handling has a short syntax form: assume a method or block definition is an implicit begin ... end expression, then specify rescue, else, and ensure clauses:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute if an exception is raised\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  rescue\n    # execute if an exception is raised\n  end\nend\n\nWith ensure:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  # always execute this\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  ensure\n    # always execute this\n  end\nend\n\n# Similarly, the shorthand also works with blocks:\n(1..10).each do |n|\n  # potentially dangerous operation\n\n\nrescue\n  # ..\nelse\n  # ..\nensure\n  # ..\nend\n\nType inference\nVariables declared inside the begin part of an exception handler also get the Nil type when considered inside a rescue or ensure body. For example:\nbegin\n  a = something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nThe above happens even if something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32 never raises, or if a was assigned a value and then a method that potentially raises is executed:\nbegin\n  a = 1\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nAlthough it is obvious that a will always be assigned a value, the compiler will still think a might never had a chance to be initialized. Even though this logic might improve in the future, right now it forces you to keep your exception handlers to their necessary minimum, making the code's intention more clear:\n# Clearer than the above: `a` doesn't need\n# to be in the exception handling code.\na = 1\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # works\nend\n\nAlternative ways to do error handling\nAlthough exceptions are available as one of the mechanisms for handling errors, they are not your only choice. Raising an exception involves allocating memory, and executing an exception handler is generally slow.\nThe standard library usually provides a couple of methods to accomplish something: one raises, one returns nil. For example:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\narray[4]  # raises because of IndexError\narray[4]? # returns nil because of index out of bounds\n\nThe usual convention is to provide an alternative \"question\" method to signal that this variant of the method returns nil instead of raising. This lets the user choose whether she wants to deal with exceptions or with nil. Note, however, that this is not available for every method out there, as exceptions are still the preferred way because they don't pollute the code with error handling logic.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html","title":"型別語法","keywords":"","body":"Type grammar\nWhen:\n\nspecifying type restrictions\nspecifying type arguments\ndeclaring variables\ndeclaring aliases\ndeclaring typedefs\nthe argument of an is_a? pseudo-call\nthe argument of an as expression\nthe argument of a sizeof expression\nthe argument of an instance_sizeof expression\na method's return type\n\na convenient syntax is provided for some common types.

Refer to Pitfalls for more information.\nScope\nMacros declared at the top-level are visible anywhere. If a top-level macro is marked as private it is only accessible in that file.\nThey can also be defined in classes and modules, and are visible in those scopes. Macros are also looked-up in the ancestors chain (superclasses and included modules).\nFor example, a block which is given an object to use as the default receiver by being invoked with with ... yield can access macros defined within that object's ancestors chain:\nclass Foo\n  macro emphasize(value)\n    \"***#{ {{value}} }***\"\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { emphasize(10) } # => \"***10***\"\n\nMacros defined in classes and modules can be invoked from outside of them too:\nclass Foo\n  macro emphasize(value)\n    \"***#{ {{value}} }***\"\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.emphasize(10) # => \"***10***\"\n\nInterpolation\nYou use {{...}} to paste, or interpolate, an AST node, as in the above example.\nNote that the node is pasted as-is.

You can use the method ASTNode#id in these cases, where you just need an identifier.\nMacro calls\nYou can invoke a fixed subset of methods on AST nodes at compile-time. These methods are documented in a fictitious Crystal::Macros module.\nFor example, invoking ASTNode#id in the above example solves the problem:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{content}}\n  end\nend\n\n# This correctly generates:\n#\n#     def foo\n#       1\n#     end\ndefine_method :foo, 1\n\nModules and classes\nModules, classes and structs can also be generated:\nmacro define_class(module_name, class_name, method, content)\n  module {{module_name}}\n    class {{class_name}}\n      def initialize(@name : String)\n      end\n\n      def {{method}}\n        {{content}} + @name\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#     module Foo\n#       class Bar\n#         def initialize(@name : String)\n#         end\n#\n#         def say\n#           \"hi \" + @name\n#         end\n#       end\n#     end\ndefine_class Foo, Bar, say, \"hi \"\n\np Foo::Bar.new(\"John\").say # => \"hi John\"\n\nConditionals\nYou use {% if condition %} ... {% end %} to conditionally generate code:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name}}\n    {% if content == 1 %}\n      \"one\"\n    {% elsif content == 2 %}\n      \"two\"\n    {% else %}\n      {{content}}\n    {% end %}\n  end\nend\n\ndefine_method foo, 1\ndefine_method bar, 2\ndefine_method baz, 3\n\nfoo # => one\nbar # => two\nbaz # => 3\n\nSimilar to regular code, Nop, NilLiteral and a false BoolLiteral are considered falsey, while everything else is considered truthy.\nMacro conditionals can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% if env(\"TEST\") %}\n  puts \"We are in test mode\"\n{% end %}\n\nIteration\nYou can iterate a finite amount of times:\nmacro define_constants(count)\n  {% for i in (1..count) %}\n    PI_{{i.id}} = Math::PI * {{i}}\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_constants(3)\n\nPI_1 # => 3.14159...\nPI_2 # => 6.28318...\nPI_3 # => 9.42477...\n\nTo iterate an ArrayLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods [foo, bar, baz]\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nThe index variable in the above example is optional.\nTo iterate a HashLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(hash)\n  {% for key, value in hash %}\n    def {{key.id}}\n      {{value}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods({foo: 10, bar: 20})\nfoo # => 10\nbar # => 20\n\nMacro iterations can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nVariadic arguments and splatting\nA macro can accept variadic arguments:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(*names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods foo, bar, baz\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nThe arguments are packed into an ArrayLiteral and passed to the macro.\nAdditionally, using * when interpolating an ArrayLiteral interpolates the elements separated by commas:\nmacro println(*values)\n  print {{*values}}, '\\n'\nend\n\nprintln 1, 2, 3 # outputs 123\\n\n\nType information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the current scope, or type, with a special instance variable: @type. The type of this variable is TypeNode, which gives you access to type information at compile time.\nNote that @type is always the instance type, even when the macro is invoked in a class method.\nFor example:\nmacro add_describe_methods\n  def describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\n\n  def self.describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\nend\n\nclass Foo\n  add_describe_methods\nend\n\nFoo.new.describe # => \"Class is Foo\"\nFoo.describe     # => \"Class is Foo\"\n\nMethod information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the method, the macro is in with a special instance variable: @def. The type of this variable is Def unless the macro is outside of a method, in this case it's NilLiteral.\nExample:\nmodule Foo\n  def Foo.boo(arg1, arg2)\n    {% @def.receiver %} # => Foo\n    {% @def.name %}     # => boo\n    {% @def.args %}     # => [arg1, arg2]\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.boo(0, 1)\n\nConstants\nMacros can access constants. For example:\nVALUES = [1, 2, 3]\n\n{% for value in VALUES %}\n  puts {{value}}\n{% end %}\n\nIf the constant denotes a type, you get back a TypeNode.\nNested macros\nIt is possible to define a macro which generates one or more macro definitions. You must escape macro expressions of the inner macro by preceding them with a backslash character \"\\\" to prevent them from being evaluated by the outer macro.\nmacro define_macros(*names)\n  {% for name in names %}\n    macro greeting_for_{{name.id}}(greeting)\n      \\{% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n        \"¡hola {{name.id}}!\"\n      \\{% else %}\n        \"\\{{greeting.id}} {{name.id}}\"\n      \\{% end %}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#\n#     macro greeting_for_alice\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola alice!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} alice\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\n#     macro greeting_for_bob\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola bob!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} bob\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\ndefine_macros alice, bob\n\ngreeting_for_alice \"hello\" # => \"hello alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hallo\"   # => \"hallo bob\"\ngreeting_for_alice \"hej\"   # => \"hej alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hola\"    # => \"¡hola bob!\"\n\nverbatim\nAnother way to define a nested macro is by using the special verbatim call. Using this you will not be able to use any variable interpolation but will not need to escape the inner macro characters.\nmacro define_macros(*names)\n  {% for name in names %}\n    macro greeting_for_{{name.id}}(greeting)\n\n      # name will not be available within the verbatim block\n      \\{% name = {{name.stringify}} %}\n\n      {% verbatim do %}\n        {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n          \"¡hola {{name.id}}!\"\n        {% else %}\n          \"{{greeting.id}} {{name.id}}\"\n        {% end %}\n      {% end %}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#\n#     macro greeting_for_alice\n#       {% name = \"alice\" %}\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola alice!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} alice\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\n#     macro greeting_for_bob\n#       {% name = \"bob\" %}\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola bob!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} bob\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\ndefine_macros alice, bob\n\ngreeting_for_alice \"hello\" # => \"hello alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hallo\"   # => \"hallo bob\"\ngreeting_for_alice \"hej\"   # => \"hej alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hola\"    # => \"¡hola bob!\"\n\nNotice the variables in the inner macro are not available within the verbatim block. The contents of the block are transferred \"as is\", essentially as a string, until re-examined by the compiler.\nComments\nMacro expressions are evaluated both within comments as well as compilable sections of code. This may be used to provide relevant documentation for expansions:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  # Provides a placeholder {{name.id}} method. Always returns {{index}}.\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nThis evaluation applies to both interpolation and directives. As a result of this, macros cannot be commented out.\nmacro a\n  # {% if false %}\n  puts 42\n  # {% end %}\nend\n\na\n\nThe expression above will result in no output.\nPitfalls\nWhen writing macros (especially outside of a macro definition) it is important to remember that the generated code from the macro must be valid Crystal code by itself even before it is merged into the main program's code. This means, for example, a macro cannot generate a one or more when expressions of a case statement unless case was a part of the generated code.\nHere is an example of such an invalid macro:\ncase 42\n{% for klass in [Int32, String] %} # Syntax Error: unexpected token: {% (expecting when, else or end)\n  when {{klass.id}}\n    p \"is {{klass}}\"\n{% end %}\nend\n\nNotice that case is not within the macro. The code generated by the macro consists solely of two when expressions which, by themselves, is not valid Crystal code. We must include case within the macro in order to make it valid by using begin and end:\n{% begin %}\n  case 42\n  {% for klass in [Int32, String] %}\n    when {{klass.id}}\n      p \"is {{klass}}\"\n  {% end %}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html","title":"Macro methods","keywords":"","body":"Macro methods\nMacro defs allow you to define a method for a class hierarchy which is then instantiated for each concrete subtype.\nA def is implicitly considered a macro def if it contains a macro expression which refers to @type.

One of the main benefits of annotations is that they are applied directly to instance variables/methods, which causes classes to look more natural since a standard macro is not needed to create these properties/methods.\nA few applications for annotations:\nObject Serialization\nHave an annotation that when applied to an instance variable determines if that instance variable should be serialized, or with what key.

The name and type of the instance variable can be read off the TypeNode in addition to the annotation; removing the need for any ORM specific macro.

Use them in bindings like this:\nlib MyLib\n  fun my_fun(some_size : LibC::SizeT)\nend\n\nNote: The C char type is UInt8 in Crystal, so a char* or a const char* is UInt8*.

This custom data is then sent as an argument to the callback. For example, suppose a C function that invokes a callback at every tick, passing that tick:\nlib LibTicker\n  fun on_tick(callback : (Int32, Void* ->), data : Void*)\nend\n\nTo properly define a wrapper for this function we must send the Proc as the callback data, and then convert that callback data to the Proc and finally invoke it.\nmodule Ticker\n  # The callback for the user doesn't have a Void*\n  @@box : Pointer(Void)?\n\n  def self.on_tick(&callback : Int32 ->)\n    # Since Proc is a {Void*, Void*}, we can't turn that into a Void*, so we\n    # \"box\" it: we allocate memory and store the Proc there\n    boxed_data = Box.box(callback)\n\n    # We must save this in Crystal-land so the GC doesn't collect it (*)\n    @@box = boxed_data\n\n    # We pass a callback that doesn't form a closure, and pass the boxed_data as\n    # the callback data\n    LibTicker.on_tick(->(tick, data) {\n      # Now we turn data back into the Proc, using Box.unbox\n      data_as_callback = Box(typeof(callback)).unbox(data)\n      # And finally invoke the user's callback\n      data_as_callback.call(tick)\n    }, boxed_data)\n  end\nend\n\nTicker.on_tick do |tick|\n  puts tick\nend\n\nNote that we save the boxed callback in @@box. The reason is that if we don't do it, and our code doesn't reference it anymore, the GC will collect it. The C library will of course store the callback, but Crystal's GC has no way of knowing that.\nRaises attribute\nIf a C function executes a user-provided callback that might raise, it must be annotated with the @[Raises] attribute.\nThe compiler infers this attribute for a method if it invokes a method that is marked as @[Raises] or raises (recursively).\nHowever, some C functions accept callbacks to be executed by other C functions. For example, suppose a fictitious library:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nLibFoo.store_callback ->{ raise \"OH NO!\" }\nLibFoo.execute_callback\n\nIf the callback passed to store_callback raises, then execute_callback will raise. However, the compiler doesn't know that execute_callback can potentially raise because it is not marked as @[Raises] and the compiler has no way to figure this out. In these cases you have to manually mark such functions:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n\n  @[Raises]\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nIf you don't mark them, begin/rescue blocks that surround this function's calls won't work as expected.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html","title":"Unsafe code","keywords":"","body":"Unsafe code\nThese parts of the language are considered unsafe:\n\nCode involving raw pointers: the Pointer type and pointerof.\nThe allocate class method.\nCode involving C bindings\nUninitialized variable declaration\n\n\"Unsafe\" means that memory corruption, segmentation faults and crashes are possible to achieve.

It represents the runway through which statements travel from our application to the database.\nIn Crystal we have two ways of building this connection. And so, coming up next, we are going to present examples with some advice on when to use each one.\nDB module\n\nGive me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.Archimedes\n\nThe DB module, is our place to stand when working with databases in Crystal. As written in the documentation: is a unified interface for database access.\nOne of the methods implemented in this module is DB#connect. Using this method is the first way for creating a connection. Let's see how to use it.\nDB#connect\nWhen using DB#connect we are indeed opening a connection to the database. The uri passed as the parameter is used by the module to determine which driver to use (for example: mysql://, postgres://, sqlite://, etc.) i.e. we do not need to specify which database we are using.\nThe uri for this example is mysql://root:root@localhost/test, and so the module will use the mysql driver to connect to the MySQL database.\nHere is the example:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\ncnn = DB.connect(\"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\")\nputs typeof(cnn) # => DB::Connection\ncnn.close\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the method returns a DB::Connection object. Although more specifically, it returns a MySql::Connection object, it doesn't matter because all types of connections should be polymorphic. So hereinafter we will work with a DB::Connection instance, helping us to abstract from specific issues of each database engine.\nWhen creating a connection manually (as we are doing here) we are responsible for managing this resource, and so we must close the connection when we are done using it. Regarding the latter, this little details can be the cause of huge bugs! Crystal, being a language for humans, give us a more safe way of manually creating a connection using blocks, like this:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.connect \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |cnn|\n  puts typeof(cnn) # => DB::Connection\nend # the connection will be closed here\n\nOk, now we have a connection, let's use it!\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.connect \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |cnn|\n  puts typeof(cnn)                         # => DB::Connection\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\n\n  result = cnn.exec(\"drop table if exists contacts\")\n  puts result\n\n  result = cnn.exec(\"create table contacts (name varchar(30), age int)\")\n  puts result\n\n  cnn.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn2 = tx.connection\n    puts \"Yep, it is the same connection! #{cnn == cnn2}\"\n\n    cnn2.exec(\"insert into contacts values ('Joe', 42)\")\n    cnn2.exec(\"insert into contacts values (?, ?)\", \"Sarah\", 43)\n  end\n\n  cnn.query_each \"select * from contacts\" do |rs|\n    puts \"name: #{rs.read}, age: #{rs.read}\"\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, in this example, we are using a transaction (check the transactions section for more information on this topic)\nSecond, it's important to notice that the connection given by the transaction is the same connection that we were working with, before the transaction begin. That is, there is only one connection at all times in our program.\nAnd last, we are using the method #exec and #query. You may read more about executing queries in the database section.\nNow that we have a good idea about creating a connection, let's present the second way for creating one: DB#open\nDB#open\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\ndb = DB.open(\"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\")\nputs typeof(db) # DB::Database\ndb.close\n\nAs with a connection, we should close the database once we don't need it anymore.\nOr instead, we could use a block and let Crystal close the database for us!\nBut, where is the connection?\nWell, we should be asking for the connections. When a database is created, a pool of connections is created with connections to the database prepared and ready to use! (Do you want to read more about pool of connections? In the connection pool section you may read all about this interesting topic!)\nHow do we use a connection from the database object?\nFor this, we could ask the database for a connection using the method Database#checkout. But, doing this will require to explicitly return the connection to the pool using Connection#release. Here is an example:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  cnn = db.checkout\n  puts typeof(cnn)\n\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\n  cnn.release\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\nend\n\nAnd we want a safe way (i.e. no need for us to release the connection) to request and use a connection from the database, we could use Database#using_connection:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  db.using_connection do |cnn|\n    puts typeof(cnn)\n    # use cnn\n  end\nend\n\nIn the next example we will let the database object to manage the connections by itself, like this:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  db.exec(\"drop table if exists contacts\")\n  db.exec(\"create table contacts (name varchar(30), age int)\")\n\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n    cnn.exec(\"insert into contacts values ('Joe', 42)\")\n    cnn.exec(\"insert into contacts values (?, ?)\", \"Sarah\", 43)\n  end\n\n  db.query_each \"select * from contacts\" do |rs|\n    puts \"name: #{rs.read}, age: #{rs.read}\"\n  end\nend\n\nAs we may notice, the database is polymorphic with a connection object with regard to the #exec / #query / #transaction methods. The database is responsible for the use of the connections. Great!\nWhen to use one or the other?\nGiven the examples, it may come to our attention that the number of connections is relevant.\nIf we are programming a short living application with only one user starting requests to the  database then a single connection managed by us (i.e. a DB::Connection object) should be enough (think of a command line application that receives parameters, then starts a request to the database and finally displays the result to the user)\nOn the other hand, if we are building a system with many concurrent users and with heavy database access, then we should use a DB::Database object; which by using a connection pool will have a number of connections already prepared and ready to use (no bootstrap/initialization-time penalizations). Or imagine that you are building a long-living application (like a background job) then a connection pool will free you from the responsibility of monitoring the state of the connection: is it alive or does it need to reconnect?\n"},"database/connection_pool.html":{"url":"database/connection_pool.html","title":"Connection pool","keywords":"","body":"Connection pool\nWhen a connection is established it usually means opening a TCP connection or Socket. The socket will handle one statement at a time. If a program needs to perform many queries simultaneously, or if it handles concurrent requests that aim to use a database, it will need more than one active connection.\nSince databases are separate services from the application using them, the connections might go down, the services might be restarted, and other sort of things the program might not want to care about.\nTo address this issues usually a connection pool is a neat solution.\nWhen a database is opened with crystal-db there is already a connection pool working. DB.open returns a DB::Database object which manages the whole connection pool and not just a single connection.\nDB.open(\"mysql://root@localhost/test\") do |db|\n  # db is a DB::Database\nend\n\nWhen executing statements using db.query, db.exec, db.scalar, etc. the algorithm goes:\n\nFind an available connection in the pool.\nCreate one if needed and possible.\nIf the pool is not allowed to create a new connection, wait a for a connection to become available.\nBut this wait should be aborted if it takes too long.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout that connection from the pool.\nExecute the SQL command.\nIf there is no DB::ResultSet yielded, return the connection to the pool. Otherwise, the connection will be returned to the pool when the ResultSet is closed.\nReturn the statement result.\n\nIf a connection can't be created, or if a connection loss occurs while the statement is performed the above process is repeated.\n\nThe retry logic only happens when the statement is sent through the DB::Database . If it is sent through a DB::Connection or DB::Transaction no retry is performed since the code will state that certain connection object was expected to be used.\n\nConfiguration\nThe behavior of the pool can be configured from a set of parameters that can appear as query string in the connection URI.\n\n\n\nName\nDefault value\n\n\n\n\ninitial_pool_size\n1\n\n\nmax_pool_size\n0 (unlimited)\n\n\nmax_idle_pool_size\n1\n\n\ncheckout_timeout\n5.0 (seconds)\n\n\nretry_attempts\n1\n\n\nretry_delay\n1.0 (seconds)\n\n\n\nWhen DB::Database is opened an initial number of initial_pool_size connections will be created. The pool will never hold more than max_pool_size connections. When returning/releasing a connection to the pool it will be closed if there are already max_idle_pool_size idle connections.\nIf the max_pool_size was reached and a connection is needed, wait up to checkout_timeout seconds for an existing connection to become available.\nIf a connection is lost or can't be established retry at most retry_attempts times waiting retry_delay seconds between each try.\nSample\nThe following program will print the current time from MySQL but if the connection is lost or the whole server is down for a few seconds the program will still run without raising exceptions.\n# file: sample.cr\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root@localhost?retry_attempts=8&retry_delay=3\" do |db|\n  loop do\n    pp db.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\")\n    sleep 0.5\n  end\nend\n\n$ crystal sample.cr\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:57\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:57\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:58\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:58\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:59\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:36:59\n# stop mysql server for some seconds\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:37:06\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:37:06\ndb.scalar(\"SELECT NOW()\") # => 2016-12-16 16:37:07\n"},"database/transactions.html":{"url":"database/transactions.html","title":"Transactions","keywords":"","body":"Transactions\nWhen working with databases, it is common to need to group operations in such a way that if one fails, then we can go back to the latest safe state.\nThis solution is described in the transaction paradigm, and is implemented by most database engines as it is necessary to meet ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ACID\nWith this in mind, we present the following example:\nWe have two accounts (each represented by a name and an amount of money).\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nIn one moment a transfer is made from one account to the other. For example, John transfers $50 to Sarah\nWe have two accounts (each represented by a name and an amount of money).\ndeposit db, \"Sarah\", 50\nwithdraw db, \"John\", 50\n\nIt is important to have in mind that if one of the operations fails then the final state would be inconsistent. So we need to execute the two operations (deposit and withdraw) as one operation. And if an error occurs then we would like to go back in time as if that one operation was never executed.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\ndb.transaction do |tx|\n  cnn = tx.connection\n\n  transfer_amount = 1000\n  deposit cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount\n  withdraw cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount\nend\n\nIn the above example, we start a transaction simply by calling the method Database#transaction (how we get the database object is encapsulated in the method get_bank_db and is out of the scope of this document).\nThe block is the body of the transaction. When the block gets executed (without any error) then an implicit commit is finally executed to persist the changes in the database.\nIf an exception is raised by one of the operations, then an implicit rollback is executed, bringing the database to the state before the transaction started.\nException handling and rolling back\nAs we mentioned early, an implicit rollback gets executed when an exception is raised, and it’s worth mentioning that the exception may be rescued by us.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 1000\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    # John does not have enough money in his account!\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Transfer has been rolled back due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nWe may also raise an exception in the body of the transaction:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n    raise Exception.new \"Because ...\"\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Transfer has been rolled back due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nAs the previous example, the exception cause the transaction to rollback and then is rescued by us.\nThere is one exception with a different behaviour. If a DB::Rollback is raised within the block, the implicit rollback will happen, but the exception will not be raised outside the block.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    # rollback exception\n    raise DB::Rollback.new\n  end\nrescue ex\n  # ex is never a DB::Rollback\nend\n\nExplicit commit and rollback\nIn all the previous examples, the rolling back is implicit, but we can also tell the transaction to rollback:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    tx.rollback\n\n    puts \"Rolling Back the changes!\"\n  end\nrescue ex\n  # Notice that no exception is used in this case.\nend\n\nAnd we can also use the commit method:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ndb.transaction do |tx|\n  cnn = tx.connection\n\n  transfer_amount = 50\n  deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n  withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n  tx.commit\nend\n\nNOTE: After commit or rollback are used, the transaction is no longer usable. The connection is still open but any statement will be performed outside the context of the terminated transaction.\nNested transactions\nAs the name suggests, a nested transaction is a transaction created inside the scope of another transaction. Here is an example:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nSome observations from the above example:\nthe inner_tx works with the values updated although the outer_tx is pending the commit.\nThe connection used by outer_tx and inner_tx is the same connection. This is because the inner_tx inherits the connection from the outer_tx when created.\nRollback nested transactions\nAs we’ve already seen, a rollback may be fired at any time (by an exception or by sending the message rollback explicitly)\nSo let’s present an example with a rollback fired by an exception placed at the outer-transaction:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n    end\n\n    raise Exception.new(\"Rollback all the things!\")\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThe rollback place in the outer_tx block, rolled back all the changes including the ones in the inner_tx block (the same happens if we use an explicit rollback).\nIf the rollback is fired by an exception at the inner_tx block all the changes including the ones in the outer_tx are rollbacked.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      raise Exception.new(\"Rollback all the things!\")\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThere is a way to rollback the changes in the inner-transaction but keep the ones in the outer-transaction. Use rollback in the inner_tx object. This will rollback only then inner-transaction. Here is the example:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      inner_tx.rollback\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThe same happens if a DB::Rollback exception is raised in the inner-transaction block.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      # Rollback exception\n      raise DB::Rollback.new\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\n\nACID.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.\n\nHowever, if you are writing a program and you realize that writing a semantically equivalent, faster version involves just minor changes, you shouldn't miss that opportunity.\nAnd always be sure to profile your program to learn what its bottlenecks are. For profiling, on macOS you can use Instruments Time Profiler, which comes with XCode. On Linux, any program that can profile C/C++ programs, like perf or Callgrind, should work.\nMake sure to always profile programs by compiling or running them with the --release flag, which turns on optimizations.\nAvoiding memory allocations\nOne of the best optimizations you can do in a program is avoiding extra/useless memory allocation. A memory allocation happens when you create an instance of a class, which ends up allocating heap memory. Creating an instance of a struct uses stack memory and doesn't incur a performance penalty. If you don't know the difference between stack and heap memory, be sure to read this.\nAllocating heap memory is slow, and it puts more pressure on the Garbage Collector (GC) as it will later have to free that memory.\nThere are several ways to avoid heap memory allocations. The standard library is designed in a way to help you do that.\nDon't create intermediate strings when writing to an IO\nTo print a number to the standard output you write:\nputs 123\nIn many programming languages what will happen is that to_s, or a similar method for converting the object to its string representation, will be invoked, and then that string will be written to the standard output. This works, but it has a flaw: it creates an intermediate string, in heap memory, only to write it and then discard it. This, involves a heap memory allocation and gives a bit of work to the GC.\nIn Crystal, puts will invoke to_s(io) on the object, passing it the IO to which the string representation should be written.\nSo, you should never do this:\nputs 123.to_s\nas it will create an intermediate string. Always append an object directly to an IO.\nWhen writing custom types, always be sure to override to_s(io), not to_s, and avoid creating intermediate strings in that method. For example:\nclass MyClass\n  # Good\n  def to_s(io)\n    # appends \"1, 2\" to IO without creating intermediate strings\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    io \nThis philosophy of appending to an IO instead of returning an intermediate string results in better performance than handling intermediate strings. You should use this strategy in your API definitions too.\nLet's compare the times:\n# io_benchmark.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nio = IO::Memory.new\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"without to_s\") do\n    io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release io_benchmark.cr\nwithout to_s  77.11M ( 12.97ns) (± 1.05%)       fastest\n   with to_s  18.15M ( 55.09ns) (± 7.99%)  4.25× slower\nAlways remember that it's not just the time that has improved: memory usage is also decreased.\nUse string interpolation instead of concatenation\nSometimes you need to work directly with strings built from combining string literals with other values. You shouldn't just concatenate these strings with String#+(String) but rather use string interpolation which allows to embed expressions into a string literal: \"Hello, #{name}\" is better than \"Hello, \" +  name.to_s.\nInterpolated strings are transformed by the compiler to append to a string IO so that it automatically avoids intermediate strings. The example above translates to:\nString.build do |io|\n  io \nAvoid IO allocation for string building\nPrefer to use the dedicated String.build optimized for building strings, instead of creating an intermediate IO::Memory allocation.\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nBenchmark.ips do |bm|\n  bm.report(\"String.build\") do\n    String.build do |io|\n      99.times do\n        io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release str_benchmark.cr\nString.build 597.57k (  1.67µs) (± 5.52%)       fastest\n  IO::Memory 423.82k (  2.36µs) (± 3.76%)  1.41× slower\nAvoid creating temporary objects over and over\nConsider this program:\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n  if [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n    lines_with_language_reference += 1\n  end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\nThe above program works but has a big performance problem: on every iteration a new array is created for [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]. Remember: an array literal is just syntax sugar for creating an instance of an array and adding some values to it, and this will happen over and over on each iteration.\nThere are two ways to solve this:\n\nUse a tuple. If you use {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"} in the above program it will work the same way, but since a tuple doesn't involve heap memory it will be faster, consume less memory, and give more chances for the compiler to optimize the program.\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"}.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\nMove the array to a constant.\nLANGS = [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if LANGS.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\n\nUsing tuples is the preferred way.\nExplicit array literals in loops is one way to create temporary objects, but these can also be created via method calls. For example Hash#keys will return a new array with the keys each time it's invoked. Instead of doing that, you can use Hash#each_key, Hash#has_key? and other methods.\nUse structs when possible\nIf you declare your type as a struct instead of a class, creating an instance of it will use stack memory, which is much cheaper than heap memory and doesn't put pressure on the GC.\nYou shouldn't always use a struct, though. Structs are passed by value, so if you pass one to a method and the method makes changes to it, the caller won't see those changes, so they can be bug-prone. The best thing to do is to only use structs with immutable objects, especially if they are small.\nFor example:\n# class_vs_struct.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nclass PointClass\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nstruct PointStruct\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"class\") { PointClass.new(1, 2) }\n  x.report(\"struct\") { PointStruct.new(1, 2) }\nend\n\nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release class_vs_struct.cr\n class  28.17M (± 2.86%) 15.29× slower\nstruct 430.82M (± 6.58%)       fastest\nIterating strings\nStrings in Crystal always contain UTF-8 encoded bytes. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding: a character may be represented by several bytes, although characters in the ASCII range are always represented by a single byte. Because of this, indexing a string with String#[] is not an O(1) operation, as the bytes need to be decoded each time to find the character at the given position. There's an optimization that Crystal's String does here: if it knows all the characters in the string are ASCII, then String#[] can be implemented in O(1). However, this isn't generally true.\nFor this reason, iterating a String in this way is not optimal, and in fact has a complexity of O(n^2):\nstring = \"foo\"\nwhile i \nThere's a second problem with the above: computing the size of a String is also slow, because it's not simply the number of bytes in the string (the bytesize). However, once a String's size has been computed, it is cached.\nThe way to improve performance in this case is to either use one of the iteration methods (each_char, each_byte, each_codepoint), or use the more low-level Char::Reader struct. For example, using each_char:\nstring = \"foo\"\nstring.each_char do |char|\n  # ...\nend\n\n"},"guides/concurrency.html":{"url":"guides/concurrency.html","title":"Concurrency","keywords":"","body":"Concurrency\nConcurrency vs. Parallelism\nThe definitions of \"concurrency\" and \"parallelism\" sometimes get mixed up, but they are not the same.\nA concurrent system is one that can be in charge of many tasks, although not necessarily it is executing them at the same time. You can think of yourself being in the kitchen cooking: you chop an onion, put it to fry, and while it's being fried you chop a tomato, but you are not doing all of those things at the same time: you distribute your time between those tasks. Parallelism would be to stir fry onions with one hand while with the other one you chop a tomato.\nAt the moment of this writing, Crystal has concurrency support but not parallelism: several tasks can be executed, and a bit of time will be spent on each of these, but two code paths are never executed at the same exact time.\nA Crystal program executes in a single operating system thread, except the Garbage Collector (GC) which implements a concurrent mark-and-sweep (currently Boehm GC).\nFibers\nTo achieve concurrency, Crystal has fibers. A fiber is in a way similar to an operating system thread except that it's much more lightweight and its execution is managed internally by the process. So, a program will spawn multiple fibers and Crystal will make sure to execute them when the time is right.\nEvent loop\nFor everything I/O related there's an event loop. Some time-consuming operations are delegated to it, and while the event loop waits for that operation to finish the program can continue executing other fibers. A simple example of this is waiting for data to come through a socket.\nChannels\nCrystal has Channels inspired by CSP. They allow communicating data between fibers without sharing memory and without having to worry about locks, semaphores or other special structures.\nExecution of a program\nWhen a program starts, it fires up a main fiber that will execute your top-level code. There, one can spawn many other fibers. The components of a program are:\n\nThe Runtime Scheduler, in charge of executing all fibers when the time is right.\nThe Event Loop, which is just another fiber, being in charge of async tasks, like for example files, sockets, pipes, signals and timers (like doing a sleep).\nChannels, to communicate data between fibers. The Runtime Scheduler will coordinate fibers and channels for their communication.\nGarbage Collector: to clean up \"no longer used\" memory.\n\nA Fiber\nA fiber is an execution unit that is more lightweight than a thread. It's a small object that has an associated stack of 8MB, which is what is usually assigned to an operating system thread.\nFibers, unlike threads, are cooperative. Threads are pre-emptive: the operating system might interrupt a thread at any time and start executing another one. A fiber must explicitly tell the Runtime Scheduler to switch to another fiber. For example if there's I/O to be waited on, a fiber will tell the scheduler \"Look, I have to wait for this I/O to be available, you continue executing other fibers and come back to me when that I/O is ready\".\nThe advantage of being cooperative is that a lot of the overhead of doing a context switch (switching between threads) is gone.\nA Fiber is much more lightweight than a thread: even though it's assigned 8MB, it starts with a small stack of 4KB.\nOn a 64-bit machine it lets us spawn millions and millions of fibers. In a 32-bit machine we can only spawn 512 fibers, which is not a lot. But because 32-bit machines are starting to become obsolete, we'll bet on the future and focus more on 64-bit machines.\nThe Runtime Scheduler\nThe scheduler has a queue of:\n\nFibers ready to be executed: for example when you spawn a fiber, it's ready to be executed.\nThe event loop: which is another fiber. When there are no other fibers ready to be executed, the event loop checks if there is any async operation that is ready, and then executes the fiber waiting for that operation. The event loop is currently implemented with libevent, which is an abstraction of other event mechanisms like epoll and kqueue.\nFibers that voluntarily asked to wait: this is done with Fiber.yield, which means \"I can continue executing, but I'll give you some time to execute other fibers if you want\".\n\nCommunicating data\nBecause at this moment there's only a single thread executing your code, accessing and modifying a class variable in different fibers will work just fine. However, once multiple threads (parallelism) is introduced in the language, it might break. That's why the recommended mechanism to communicate data is using channels and sending messages between them. Internally, a channel implements all the locking mechanisms to avoid data races, but from the outside you use them as communication primitives, so you (the user) don't have to use locks.\nSample code\nSpawning a fiber\nTo spawn a fiber you use spawn with a block:\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  socket.gets\n  # ...\nend\n\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  sleep 5.seconds\n  #  ...\nend\n\nHere we have two fibers: one reads from a socket and the other does a sleep. When the first fiber reaches the socket.gets line, it gets suspended, the Event Loop is told to continue executing this fiber when there's data in the socket, and the program continues with the second fiber. This fiber wants to sleep for 5 seconds, so the Event Loop is told to continue with this fiber in 5 seconds. If there aren't other fibers to execute, the Event Loop will wait until either of these events happen, without consuming CPU time.\nThe reason why socket.gets and sleep behave like this is because their implementations talk directly with the Runtime Scheduler and the Event Loop, there's nothing magical about it. In general, the standard library already takes care of doing all of this so you don't have to.\nNote, however, that fibers don't get executed right away. For example:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nRunning the above code will produce no output and exit immediately.\nThe reason for this is that a fiber is not executed as soon as it is spawned. So, the main fiber, the one that spawns the above fiber, finishes its execution and the program exits.\nOne way to solve it is to do a sleep:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep 1.second\n\nThis program will now print \"Hello!\" for one second and then exit. This is because the sleep call will schedule the main fiber to be executed in a second, and then executes another \"ready to execute\" fiber, which in this case is the one above.\nAnother way is this:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nThis time Fiber.yield will tell the scheduler to execute the other fiber. This will print \"Hello!\" until the standard output blocks (the system call will tell us we have to wait until the output is ready), and then execution continues with the main fiber and the program exits. Here the standard output might never block so the program will continue executing forever.\nIf we want to execute the spawned fiber for ever, we can use sleep without arguments:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep\n\nOf course the above program can be written without spawn at all, just with a loop. sleep is more useful when spawning more than one fiber.\nSpawning a call\nYou can also spawn by passing a method call instead of a block. To understand why this is useful, let's look at this example:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThe above program prints \"10\" ten times. The problem is that there's only one variable i that all spawned fibers refer to, and when Fiber.yield is executed its value is 10.\nTo solve this, we can do this:\ni = 0\nwhile i (x : Int32) do\n    spawn do\n      puts(x)\n    end\n  end\n  proc.call(i)\n  i += 1\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nNow it works because we are creating a Proc and we invoke it passing i, so the value gets copied and now the spawned fiber receives a copy.\nTo avoid all this boilerplate, the standard library provides a spawn macro that accepts a call expression and basically rewrites it to do the above. Using it, we end up with:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThis is mostly useful with local variables that change at iterations. This doesn't happen with block arguments. For example, this works as expected:\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    puts i\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nSpawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete\nWe can use a channel for this:\nchannel = Channel(Nil).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(nil)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before receive\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"After receive\"\n\nThis prints:\nBefore receive\nBefore send\nAfter receive\n\nFirst, the program spawns a fiber but doesn't execute it yet. When we invoke channel.receive, the main fiber blocks and execution continues with the spawned fiber. Then channel.send(nil) is invoked, and so execution continues at channel.receive, which was waiting for a value. Then the main fiber continues executing and finishes, so the program exits without giving the other fiber a chance to print \"After send\".\nIn the above example we used nil just to communicate that the fiber ended. We can also use channels to communicate values between fibers:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before first send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before second send\"\n  channel.send(2)\nend\n\nputs \"Before first receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1\n\nputs \"Before second receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2\n\nOutput:\nBefore first receive\nBefore first send\n1\nBefore second receive\nBefore second send\n2\n\nNote that when the program executes a receive, that fiber blocks and execution continues with the other fiber. When send is executed, execution continues with the fiber that was waiting on that channel.\nHere we are sending literal values, but the spawned fiber might compute this value by, for example, reading a file, or getting it from a socket. When this fiber will have to wait for I/O, other fibers will be able to continue executing code until I/O is ready, and finally when the value is ready and sent through the channel, the main fiber will receive it. For example:\nrequire \"socket\"\n\nchannel = Channel(String).new\n\nspawn do\n  server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080)\n  socket = server.accept\n  while line = socket.gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\nspawn do\n  while line = gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\n3.times do\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nThe above program spawns two fibers. The first one creates a TCPServer, accepts one connection and reads lines from it, sending them to the channel. There's a second fiber reading lines from standard input. The main fiber reads the first 3 messages sent to the channel, either from the socket or stdin, then the program exits. The gets calls will block the fibers and tell the Event Loop to continue from there if data comes.\nLikewise, we can wait for multiple fibers to complete execution, and gather their values:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    channel.send(i * 2)\n  end\nend\n\nsum = 0\n10.times do\n  sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90\n\nYou can, of course, use receive inside a spawned fiber:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before receive\"\n  puts channel.receive\n  puts \"After receive\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"After yield\"\n\nOutput:\nBefore yield\nBefore send\nBefore receive\n1\nAfter receive\nAfter send\nAfter yield\n\nHere channel.send is executed first, but since there's no one waiting for a value (yet), execution continues in other fibers. The second fiber is executed, there's a value on the channel, it's obtained, and execution continues, first with the first fiber, then with the main fiber, because Fiber.yield puts a fiber at the end of the execution queue.\nBuffered channels\nThe above examples use unbuffered channels: when sending a value, if a fiber is waiting on that channel then execution continues on that fiber.\nWith a buffered channel, invoking send won't switch to another fiber unless the buffer is full:\n# A buffered channel of capacity 2\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new(2)\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send 1\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before send 2\"\n  channel.send(2)\n  puts \"Before send 3\"\n  channel.send(3)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\n3.times do |i|\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nOutput:\nBefore send 1\nBefore send 2\nBefore send 3\n1\n2\nAfter send\n3\nNote that the first 2 sends are executed without switching to another fiber. However, in the third send the channel's buffer is full, so execution goes to the main fiber. Here the two values are received and the channel is depleted. At the third receive the main fiber blocks and execution goes to the other fiber, which sends more values, finishes, etc.\n"},"guides/testing.html":{"url":"guides/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing Crystal Code\nCrystal comes with a fully-featured spec library in the Spec module. It provides a structure for writing executable examples of how your code should behave.\nInspired by Rspec, it includes a domain specific language (DSL) that allows you to write examples in a way similar to plain english.\nA basic spec looks something like this:\nrequire \"spec\"\n\ndescribe Array do\n  describe \"#size\" do\n    it \"correctly reports the number of elements in the Array\" do\n      [1, 2, 3].size.should eq 3\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe \"#empty?\" do\n    it \"is true when no elements are in the array\" do\n      ([] of Int32).empty?.should be_true\n    end\n\n    it \"is false if there are elements in the array\" do\n      [1].empty?.should be_false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nAnatomy of a spec file\nTo use the spec module and DSL, you need to add require \"spec\" to your spec files. Many projects use a custom spec helper which organizes these includes.\nConcrete test cases are defined in it blocks. An optional (but strongly recommended) descriptive string states it's purpose and a block contains the main logic performing the test.\nTest cases that have been defined or outlined but are not yet expected to work can be defined using pending instead of it. They will not be run but show up in the spec report as pending.\nAn it block contains an example that should invoke the code to be tested and define what is expected of it. Each example can contain multiple expectations, but it should test only one specific behaviour.\nWhen spec is included, every object has the instance methods #should and #should_not. These methods are invoked on the value being tested with an expectation as argument. If the expectation is met, code execution continues. Otherwise the example has failed and other code in this block will not be executed.\nIn test files, specs are structured by example groups which are defined by describe and context sections. Typically a top level describe defines the outer unit (such as a class) to be tested by the spec. Further describe sections can be nested within the outer unit to specify smaller units under test (such as individual methods).\nFor unit tests, it is recommended to follow the conventions for method names: Outer describe is the name of the class, inner describe targets methods. Instance methods are prefixed with #, class methods with ..\nTo establish certain contexts - think empty array versus array with elements - the context method may be used to communicate this to the reader. It has a different name, but behaves exactly like describe.\ndescribe and context take a description as argument (which should usually be a string) and a block containing the individual specs or nested groupings.\nExpectations\nExpectations define if the value being tested (actual) matches a certain value or specific criteria.\nEquivalence, Identity and Type\nThere are methods to create expectations which test for equivalence (eq), identity (be), type (be_a), and nil (be_nil).\nNote that the identity expectation uses .same? which tests if #object_id are identical. This is only true if the expected value points to the same object instead of an equivalent one. This is only possible for reference types and won't work for value types like structs or numbers.\nactual.should eq(expected)   # passes if actual == expected\nactual.should be(expected)   # passes if actual.same?(expected)\nactual.should be_a(expected) # passes if actual.is_a?(expected)\nactual.should be_nil         # passes if actual.nil?\n\nTruthiness\nactual.should be_true   # passes if actual == true\nactual.should be_false  # passes if actual == false\nactual.should be_truthy # passes if actual is truthy (neither nil nor false nor Pointer.null)\nactual.should be_falsey # passes if actual is falsey (nil, false or Pointer.null)\n\nComparisons\nactual.should be  expected  # passes if actual >  expected\nactual.should be >= expected # passes if actual >= expected\n\nOther matchers\nactual.should be_close(expected, delta) # passes if actual is within delta of expected:\n                                        # (actual - expected).abs \nExpecting errors\nThese matchers run a block and pass if it raises a certain exception.\nexpect_raises(MyError) do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError.\nend\n\nexpect_raises(MyError, \"error message\") do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError\n  # and the error message contains \"error message\".\nend\n\nexpect_raises(MyError, /error \\w{7}/) do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError\n  # and the error message matches the regular expression.\nend\n\nThey return the rescued exception so it can be used for further expectations, for example to verify specific properties of the exception.\nFocusing on a group of specs\ndescribe, context and it blocks can be marked with focus: true, like this:\nit \"adds\", focus: true do\n  (2 + 2).should_not eq(5)\nend\n\nIf any such thing is marked with focus: true then only those examples will run.\nTagging specs\nTags can be used to group specs, allowing to only run a subset of specs when providing a --tag argument to the spec runner (see Using the compiler).\ndescribe, context and it blocks can be tagged, like this:\nit \"is slow\", tags: \"slow\" do\n  sleep 60\n  true.should be(true)\nend\n\nit \"is fast\", tags: \"fast\" do\n  true.should be(true)\nend\n\nTagging an example group (describe or context) extends to all of the contained examples.\nMultiple tags can be specified by giving an Enumerable, such as Array or Set.\nRunning specs\nThe Crystal compiler has a spec command with tools to constrain which examples get run and tailor the output. All specs of a project are compiled and executed through the command crystal spec.\nBy convention, specs live in the spec/ directory of a project. Spec files must end with _spec.cr to be recognizable as such by the compiler command.\nYou can compile and run specs from folder trees, individual files, or specific lines in a file. If the specified line is the beginning of a describe or context section, all specs inside that group are run.\nThe default formatter outputs the file and line style command for failing specs which makes it easy to rerun just this individual spec.\nYou can turn off colors with the switch --no-color.\nRandomizing order of specs\nSpecs, by default, run in the order defined, but can be run in a random order by passing --order random to crystal spec.\nSpecs run in random order will display a seed value upon completion. This seed value can be used to rerun the specs in that same order by passing the seed value to --order.\nExamples\n# Run all specs in files matching spec/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec\n\n# Run  all specs in files matching spec/**/*_spec.cr without colors\ncrystal spec --no-color\n\n# Run all specs in files matching spec/my/test/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/\n\n# Run all specs in spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\n\n# Run the spec or group defined in line 14 of spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr:14\n\n# Run all specs tagged with \"fast\"\ncrystal spec --tag 'fast'\n\n# Run all specs not tagged with \"slow\"\ncrystal spec --tag '~slow'\n\nSpec helper\nMany projects use a custom spec helper file, usually named spec/spec_helper.cr.\nThis file is used to require spec and other includes like code from the project needed for every spec file. This is also a good place to define global helper methods that make writing specs easier and avoid code duplication.\n# spec/spec_helper.cr\nrequire \"spec\"\nrequire \"../src/my_project.cr\"\n\ndef create_test_object(name)\n  project = MyProject.new(option: false)\n  object = project.create_object(name)\n  object\nend\n\n# spec/my_project_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\n\ndescribe \"MyProject::Object\" do\n  it \"is created\" do\n    object = create_test_object(name)\n    object.should_not be_nil\n  end\nend\n\n"},"guides/writing_shards.html":{"url":"guides/writing_shards.html","title":"Writing Shards","keywords":"","body":"Writing Shards\nHow to write and release Crystal Shards.\nWhat's a Shard?\nSimply put, a Shard is a package of Crystal code, made to be shared-with and used-by other projects.\nSee the Shards command for details.\nIntroduction\nIn this tutorial, we'll be making a Crystal library called palindrome-example.\n\nFor those who don't know, a palindrome is a word which is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards. e.g. racecar, mom, dad, kayak, madam\n\nRequirements\nIn order to release a Crystal Shard, and follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:\n\nA working installation of the Crystal compiler\nA working installation of Git\nA GitHub or GitLab account\n\nCreating the Project\nBegin by using the Crystal compiler's init lib command to create a Crystal library with the standard directory structure.\nIn your terminal: crystal init lib \ne.g.\n$ crystal init lib palindrome-example\n    create  palindrome-example/.gitignore\n    create  palindrome-example/.editorconfig\n    create  palindrome-example/LICENSE\n    create  palindrome-example/README.md\n    create  palindrome-example/.travis.yml\n    create  palindrome-example/shard.yml\n    create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example.cr\n    create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n    create  palindrome-example/spec/spec_helper.cr\n    create  palindrome-example/spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\nInitialized empty Git repository in //.../palindrome-example/.git/\n\n...and cd into the directory:\ne.g.\ncd palindrome-example\n\nThen add & commit to start tracking the files with Git:\n$  git add -A\n$  git commit -am \"First Commit\"\n[master (root-commit) 77bad84] First Commit\n10 files changed, 102 insertions(+)\ncreate mode 100644 .editorconfig\ncreate mode 100644 .gitignore\ncreate mode 100644 .travis.yml\ncreate mode 100644 LICENSE\ncreate mode 100644 README.md\ncreate mode 100644 shard.yml\ncreate mode 100644 spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\ncreate mode 100644 spec/spec_helper.cr\ncreate mode 100644 src/palindrome-example.cr\ncreate mode 100644 src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n\nWriting the Code\nThe code you write is up to you, but how you write it impacts whether people want to use your library and/or help you maintain it.\nTesting the Code\n\nTest your code. All of it. It's the only way for anyone, including you, to know if it works.\nCrystal has a built-in testing library. Use it!\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocument your code with comments. All of it. Even the private methods.\nCrystal has a built-in documentation generator. Use it!\n\nRun crystal docs to convert your code and comments into interlinking API documentation. Open the files in the /docs/ directory with a web browser to see how your documentation is looking along the way.\nSee below for instructions on hosting your compiler-generated docs on GitHub/GitLab Pages.\nOnce your documentation is ready and available, you can add a documentation badge to your repository so users know that it exists. In GitLab this badge belongs to the project so we'll cover it in the GitLab instructions below, for GitHub it is common to place it below the description in your README.md like so:\n(Be sure to replace  accordingly)\n[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-brightgreen.svg)]()\n\nWriting a README\nA good README can make or break your project.\nAwesome README is a nice curation of examples and resources on the topic.\nMost importantly, your README should explain:\n\nWhat your library is\nWhat it does\nHow to use it\n\nThis explanation should include a few examples along with subheadings.\nNOTE: Be sure to replace all instances of [your-github-name] in the Crystal-generated README template with your GitHub/GitLab username. If you're using GitLab, you'll also want to change all instances of github with gitlab.\nCoding Style\n\nIt's fine to have your own style, but sticking to some core rubrics defined by the Crystal team can help keep your code consistent, readable and usable for other developers.\nUtilize Crystal's built-in code formatter to automatically format all .cr files in a directory.\n\ne.g.\ncrystal tool format\nTo check if your code is formatted correctly, or to check if using the formatter wouldn't produce any changes, simply add --check to the end of this command.\ne.g.\ncrystal tool format --check\nSee the Travis CI section below to implement this in your build.\nWriting a shard.yml\nThe spec is your rulebook.

We don't need to repeat the palindrome keyword. Instead, we'll catch Susan's search for \"spelling\" and Felipe's search for \"text\".\ndescription: |\n  A textual algorithm to tell if a word is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards.\n\nHosting\nFrom here the guide differs depending on whether you are hosting your repo on GitHub or GitLab.

The first one is titled \"spec & format\" (you can use any name you like) and by default goes in the \"test\" stage of the pipeline. It just runs the array of commands in script on a brand new instance of the docker container specified by image. You'll probably want to lock that container to the version of crystal you're using (the one specified in your shard.yml) but for this example we'll just use the latest tag.\nThe test stage of the pipeline will either pass (each element of the array returned a healthy exit code) or it will fail (one of the elements returned an error).\nIf it passes, then the pipeline will move onto the second job we defined here which we must name \"pages\". This is a special job just for deploying content to your gitlab pages site! This one is executed after tests have passed because we specified that it should occur in the \"deploy\" stage. It again runs the commands in script (this time building the docs), but this time we tell it to preserve the path public (where we stashed the docs) as an artifact of the job.\nThe result of naming this job pages and putting our docs in the public directory and specifying it as an artifact is that GitLab will deploy the site in that directory to the default URL https://.gitlab.io/.\nThe before_script and cache keys in the file are for running the same script in every job (shards install) and for hanging onto the files that were created (cache). They're not necessary if your shard doesn't have any dependencies.\nIf you commit the above file to your project and push, you'll trigger your first run of the new pipeline.\n$ git add -A && git commit -am 'Add .gitlab-ci.yml' && git push origin master\n\nSome Badges\nWhile that pipeline is running, let's attach some badges to the project to show off our docs and the (hopefully) successful state of our pipeline. (You might want to read the badges docs.)\nA badge is just a link with an image. So let's create a link to our pipeline and fetch a badge image from the Gitlab Pipeline Badges API.\nIn the Badges section of the General settings, we'll first add a release badge. The link is: https://gitlab.com///pipelines and the Badge Image URL is: https://gitlab.com///badges/master/pipeline.svg.\nAnd now if the pipleline has finished we'll have docs and we can link to them with a generic badge from shields.io.\n\nLink: https://.gitlab.io/\nImage: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-brightgreen.svg\n\nReleases\nA release is just a special commit in your history with a name (see tagging).\nAccording to the Crystal Shards README,\n\nWhen libraries are installed from Git repositories, the repository is expected to have version tags following a semver-like format, prefixed with a v. Examples: v1.2.3, v2.0.0-rc1 or v2017.04.1\n\nGitLab also has a releases feature that let's you associate files and a description with this tag. That way you can (for example) distribute binaries.\nAs you'll see from the releases docs, you can either create an annotated tag along with release notes/files in the UI:\n\nor you can create the tag from the command line like so:\n    $ git tag -a v0.1.0 -m \"Release v0.1.0\"\n\npush it up\n    $ git push origin master --follow-tags\n\nand then use the UI to add/edit the release note and attach files.\nBest Practices\n\nUse the -a option to create an annotated tag for releases.\nFollow Semantic Versioning.\n\nRelease Badge\nIf you'd like you can also add a shields.io badge for the release. GitLab doesn't have full support for this kind of thing, and until someone adds a version badge for gitlab to shields.io, we'll have to just code in the version number in the URLs directly.\n\nLink: https://img.shields.io/badge/release--brightgreen.svg\nImage: https://img.shields.io/badge/release--brightgreen.svg\n\nwhere  is the version number prefixed with a v like this: v0.1.0.\nMirror to GitHub\nAt the moment, crystalshards.xyz only uses the GitHub API, so if you want your library to be indexed on that service you can set up a \"push mirror\" from GitLab to GitHub.\n\nCreate a GitHub repository with the same name as your project.\nFollow the instructions here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/repository_mirroring.html#setting-up-a-push-mirror-from-gitlab-to-github-core\nEdit your GitHub description.

Imagine making one change to our source code and having to wait 2 weeks to see if it broke something? oh! That would be a nightmare! For this, Continuous Integration will help a team to have immediate and frequent feedback about the status of what they are building.\nMartin Fowler defines Continuous Integration as\na software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.\nIn the next subsections, we are going to present 2 continuous integration tools: Travis CI and Circle CI and use them with a Crystal example application.\nThese tools not only will let us build and test our code each time the source has changed but also deploy the result (if the build was successful) or use automatic builds, and maybe test against different platforms, to mention a few.\nThe example application\nWe are going to use Conway's Game of Life as the example application. More precisely, we are going to use only the first iterations in Conway's Game of Life Kata solution using TDD.\nNote that we won't be using TDD in the example itself, but we will mimic as if the example code is the result of the first iterations.\nAnother important thing to mention is that we are using crystal init to create the application.\nAnd here's the implementation:\n# src/game_of_life.cr\nclass Location\n  getter x : Int32\n  getter y : Int32\n\n  def self.random\n    Location.new(Random.rand(10), Random.rand(10))\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@x, @y)\n  end\nend\n\nclass World\n  @living_cells : Array(Location)\n\n  def self.empty\n    new\n  end\n\n  def initialize(living_cells = [] of Location)\n    @living_cells = living_cells\n  end\n\n  def set_living_at(a_location)\n    @living_cells \nAnd the specs:\n# spec/game_of_life_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\n\ndescribe \"a new world\" do\n  it \"should be empty\" do\n    world = World.new\n    world.is_empty?.should be_true\n  end\nend\n\ndescribe \"an empty world\" do\n  it \"should not be empty after adding a cell\" do\n    world = World.empty\n    world.set_living_at(Location.random)\n    world.is_empty?.should be_false\n  end\nend\n\nAnd this is all we need for our continuous integration examples! Let's start!\nContinuous Integration step by step\nHere's the list of items we want to achieve:\n\nBuild and run specs using 3 different Crystal's versions:\nlatest\nnightly\n0.31.1 (using a Docker image)\n\n\nInstall shards packages\nInstall binary dependencies\nUse a database (for example MySQL)\nCache dependencies to make the build run faster\n\nFrom here choose your next steps:\n\nI want to use Travis CI\nI want to use CircleCI\n\n"},"guides/ci/travis.html":{"url":"guides/ci/travis.html","title":"Using Travis CI","keywords":"","body":"Travis CI\nIn this section we are going to use Travis CI as our continuous-integration service. Travis CI is mostly used for building and running tests for projects hosted at GitHub. It supports different programming languages and for our particular case, it supports the Crystal language.\n\nNote:If you are new to continuous integration (or you want to refresh the basic concepts) we may start reading the core concepts guide.\n\nNow let's see some examples!\nBuild and run specs\nUsing latest and nightly\nA first (and very basic) Travis CI config file could be:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\n\nThat's it! With this config file, Travis CI by default will run crystal spec.\nNow, we just need to go to Travis CI dashboard to add the GitHub repository.\nLet's see another example:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\n\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n  - nightly\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal tool format --check\n\nWith this configuration, Travis CI will run the tests using both Crystal latest and nightly releases on every push to a branch on your Github repository.\nNote: When creating a Crystal project using crystal init, Crystal creates a .travis.yml file for us.\nUsing a specific Crystal release\nLet's suppose we want to pin a specific Crystal release (maybe we want to make sure the shard compiles and works with that version) for example Crystal 0.31.1.\nTravis CI only provides runners to latest and nightly releases directly and so, we need to install the requested Crystal release manually. For this we are going to use Docker.\nFirst we need to add Docker as a service in .travis.yml, and then we can use docker commands in our build steps, like this:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: minimal\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nscript:\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nNote: We may read about different (languages)[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/] supported by Travis CI, included minimal.\nNote: A list with the different official Crystal docker images is available at DockerHub.\nUsing latest, nightly and a specific Crystal release all together!\nSupported runners can be combined with Docker-based runners using a Build Matrix. This will allow us to run tests against latest and nightly and pinned releases.\nHere is the example:\n# .travis.yml\nmatrix:\n include:\n   - language: crystal\n     crystal:\n       - latest\n     script:\n       - crystal spec\n\n   - language: crystal\n     crystal:\n       - nightly\n     script:\n       - crystal spec\n\n   - language: bash\n     services:\n       - docker\n     script:\n       - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nInstalling shards packages\nIn native runners (language: crystal), Travis CI already automatically installs shards dependencies using shards install. To improve build performance we may add caching on top of that.\nUsing Docker\nIn a Docker-based runner we need to run shards install explicitly, like this:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: bash\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nscript:\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 shards install\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nNote: Since the shards will be installed in ./lib/ folder, it will be preserved for the second docker run command.\nInstalling binary dependencies\nOur application or maybe some shards may required libraries and packages. This binary dependencies may be installed using different methods. Here we are going to show an example using the Apt command (since the Docker image we are using is based on Ubuntu)\nHere is a first example installing the libsqlite3 development package using the APT addon:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nbefore_install:\n  - sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-dev\n\naddons:\n  apt:\n    update: true\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nUsing Docker\nWe are going to build a new docker image based on crystallang/crystal, and in this new image we will be installing the binary dependencies.\nTo accomplish this we are going to use a Dockerfile:\n# Dockerfile\nFROM crystallang/crystal:latest\n\n# install binary dependencies:\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev\n\nAnd here is the Travis CI configuration file:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: bash\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nbefore_install:\n  # build image using Dockerfile:\n  - docker build -t testing .\n\nscript:\n  # run specs in the container\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src testing crystal spec\n\nNote: Dockerfile arguments can be used to use the same Dockerfile for latest, nightly or a specific version.\nUsing services\nTravis CI may start services as requested.\nFor example, we can start a MySQL database service by adding a services: section to our .travis.yml:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nservices:\n  - mysql\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nHere is the new test file for testing against the database:\n# spec/simple_db_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nit \"connects to the database\" do\n  DB.connect ENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"] do |cnn|\n    cnn.query_one(\"SELECT 'foo'\", as: String).should eq \"foo\"\n  end\nend\n\nWhen pushing this changes Travis CI will report the following error: Unknown database 'test' (Exception), showing that we need to configure the MySQL service and also setup the database:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nenv:\n  global:\n    - DATABASE_NAME=test\n    - DATABASE_URL=mysql://root@localhost/$DATABASE_NAME\n\nservices:\n  - mysql\n\nbefore_install:\n  - mysql -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $DATABASE_NAME;\"\n  - mysql -u root --password=\"\" $DATABASE_NAME \nWe are using a schema.sql script to create a more readable .travis.yml. The file ./db/schema.sql looks like this:\n-- schema.sql\nCREATE TABLE ... etc ...\n\nPushing these changes will trigger Travis CI and the build should be successful!\nCaching\nIf we read Travis CI job log, we will find that every time the job runs, Travis CI needs to fetch the libraries needed to run the application:\nFetching https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-mysql.git\nFetching https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db.git\n\nThis takes time and, on the other hand, these libraries might not change as often as our application, so it looks like we may cache them and save time.\nTravis CI uses caching to improve some parts of the building path. Here is the new configuration file with cache enabled:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\ncache: shards\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nLet's push these changes. Travis CI will run, and it will install dependencies, but then it will cache the shards cache folder which, usually, is ~/.cache/shards. The following runs will use the cached dependencies.\n"},"guides/ci/circleci.html":{"url":"guides/ci/circleci.html","title":"Using CircleCI","keywords":"","body":"CircleCI\nIn this section we are going to use CircleCI as our continuous-integration service. In a few words CircleCI automates your software builds, tests, and deployments. It supports different programming languages and for our particular case, it supports the Crystal language.\nIn this section we are going to present some configuration examples to see how CircleCI implements some continuous integration concepts.\nCircleCI orbs\nBefore showing some examples, it’s worth mentioning CircleCI orbs. As defined in the official docs:\n\nOrbs define reusable commands, executors, and jobs so that commonly used pieces of configuration can be condensed into a single line of code.\n\nIn our case, we are going to use Crystal’s Orb\nBuild and run specs\nSimple example using latest\nLet’s start with a simple example. We are going to run the tests using latest Crystal release:\n# .circleci/config.yml\nworkflows:\n  version: 2\n  build:\n    jobs:\n      - crystal/test\n\norbs:\n  crystal: manastech/crystal@1.0\nversion: 2.1\n\nYeah! That was simple! With Orbs an abstraction layer is built so that the configuration file is more readable and intuitive.\nIn case we are wondering what the job crystal/test does, we always may see the source code.\nUsing nightly\nUsing nightly Crystal release is as easy as:\n# .circleci/config.yml\nworkflows:\n  version: 2\n  build:\n    jobs:\n      - crystal/test:\n          name: test-on-nightly\n          executor:\n            name: crystal/default\n            tag: nightly\n\norbs:\n  crystal: manastech/crystal@1.0\nversion: 2.1\n\nUsing a specific Crystal release\n# .circleci/config.yml\nworkflows:\n  version: 2\n  build:\n    jobs:\n      - crystal/test:\n          name: test-on-0.30\n          executor:\n            name: crystal/default\n            tag: 0.30.0\n\norbs:\n  crystal: manastech/crystal@1.0\nversion: 2.1\n\nInstalling shards packages\nYou need not worry about it since the crystal/test job runs the crystal/shard-install orb command.\nInstalling binary dependencies\nOur application or maybe some shards may require libraries and packages. This binary dependencies may be installed using the Apt command.\nHere is an example installing the libsqlite3 development package:\n# .circleci/config.yml\nworkflows:\n  version: 2\n  build:\n    jobs:\n      - crystal/test:\n          pre-steps:\n            - run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev\n\norbs:\n  crystal: manastech/crystal@1.0\nversion: 2.1\n\nUsing services\nNow, let’s run specs using an external service (for example MySQL):\n# .circleci/config.yml\nexecutors:\n  crystal_mysql:\n    docker:\n      - image: 'crystallang/crystal:latest'\n        environment:\n          DATABASE_URL: 'mysql://root@localhost/db'\n      - image: 'mysql:5.7'\n        environment:\n          MYSQL_DATABASE: db\n          MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: 'yes'\n\nworkflows:\n  version: 2\n  build:\n    jobs:\n      - crystal/test:\n          executor: crystal_mysql\n          pre-steps:\n            - run:\n                name: Waiting for service to start (check dockerize)\n                command: sleep 1m\n            - checkout\n            - run:\n                name: Install MySQL CLI; Import dummy data\n                command: |\n                        apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client\n                        mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root --password=\"\" db \nNote: The explicit checkout in the pre-steps is to have the test-data/setup.sql file available.\nCaching\nCaching is enabled by default when using the job crystal/test, because internally it uses the command with-shards-cache\n"}}}
